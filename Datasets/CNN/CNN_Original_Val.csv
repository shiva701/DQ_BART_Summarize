"(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. ""I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,"" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. ""Thanks for all the support and prayers,"" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. ""I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger."" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients. ""The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair,"" the medical center said in a statement. The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday. In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients. Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center. Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours. But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation. It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling. But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor. That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain. Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time. That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. ""When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks,"" Jacobs said. But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all. ""The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients,"" said Dr. Steven Katznelson. ""Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients."" And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page. ""You are a true angel my friend.""","Zully Broussard decided to give a kidney to a stranger .

"(CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous ""birth of a new era for American soccer."" Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period. Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start. Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015. A further four are set to be added by 2020. On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years. This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal. According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, ""the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically"" in the U.S.. He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS. Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation. He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago. This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow. World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively. ""We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment,"" Rawlins said of football's American progress. ""Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country? Yes, I think it can. And it can be in a short space of time."" These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil. Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen. That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC. Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal. Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable. And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to ""off budget"" signings which are not included within the cap. This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education. Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year. ""We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. We have a salary cap. They don't,"" Vermes said. According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further. He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports. Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic. Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS. This in turn will raise the standard further. An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira. Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012. He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014. Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. This last point is something that appears be happening already. ""Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe,"" Teixeira said. ""(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong"" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings. Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  ""is probably something we'll see more of."" Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning.

"(CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now ""feeling well"" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was ""fine,"" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. ""I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,"" Gomis told the website. ""It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. ""I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. ""I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages."" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: ""We can't not be worried, it scares you each time."" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. ""He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,"" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. ""It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. ""It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks."" Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death,  according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.","Bafetimbi Gomis collapses within 10 minutes of kickoff at Tottenham .

"(CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. ""(It) felt good at the time,"" a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. ""I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not."" The club ""must have went a good 60, 70 yards,"" he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. ""I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range,"" he said. ""That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. ""So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up."" Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes. Former world No 1., Adam Scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Bubba Watson and Henrik Stenson are tied for fourth on four-under.","Rory McIlroy throws club into water at WGC Cadillac Championship .

"(CNN)A Pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since Wednesday. The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group ""Find Cayman"" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. ""We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act,"" Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. ""We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is. Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet."" The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time. ""Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ... He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this,"" his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday. The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack. Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing. Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts. A post late Saturday explained search efforts included ""advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went,"" and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol. In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son. ""Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass. Just come home, we are so worried about you"" the family posted Saturday. A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: ""Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people. They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email. We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers.""

"(CNN)My vote for Father of the Year goes to Curt Schilling. The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter. The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father. He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. It read: ""Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!! — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)"" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter. The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. Threats of rape were common. The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious. It was vile and obscene. What was said wasn't just mean and ugly. It was threatening and scary. As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. If so, they thought wrong. They couldn't hide. They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. Thanks to dad. According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired. Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. Bravo for him. I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control. I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? There are a few. The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. But Schilling wouldn't let them. At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. A parent's top job is to protect his children. Schilling did his job. Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. There are things you don't say. There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. The tweets make you wince. But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter. Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. ​ .","Ruben Navarrette: Schilling deserves praise for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter .

"(CNN)Another one for the ""tourists behaving badly"" file. Two American women have reportedly been arrested for carving their initials into a wall with a coin inside Rome's Colosseum. Daily Italian newspaper La Stampa says the women, aged 21 and 25, were spotted carrying out the act by fellow tourists, who then told security. The two letters -- J and N -- were about eight inches in length and scratched on a brick wall at the historic Roman amphitheater. The women, both from California, reportedly snapped a selfie of themselves with their initials before they were arrested. Their names have not been released. The American pair may now face a fine for ""aggravated damage"" on a building of historical and artistic interest. If one Russian's experience is anything to go by, the price won't be cheap. Last November, authorities in Rome slapped a 20,000-euro ($21,685) penalty on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into the famed landmark. The 42-year-old man was apprehended after a guard at the Colosseum saw him carve the letter ""K"" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing aggravated damage, fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The Russian was one of five tourists caught carving graffiti on Colosseum walls in 2014. The earlier incidents involved two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome isn't alone in having to deal with inappropriate tourist behavior this month. Egypt is now looking into reports that one of its most historic sites was the backdrop for a Russian porn flick. According to Al Arabiya News, authorities have confirmed that an X-rated film was shot next to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx and are now investigating. The video was reportedly made by Russian tourists, who then uploaded it to the Internet nine months ago. Al Arabiya reports that Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh al-Demati says the issue has been referred to the public prosecutor and new surveillance cameras are being installed in the area. The incident comes as a reminder that no world landmark is safe from the salacious urges of tourists -- no matter how sacred it might be to the locals. Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced its own string of nudity-related incidents this year. In February, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. In January, a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. Early last year, Peru officials were forced to respond to a chain of ""naked tourism"" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site.

"(CNN)A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. One French citizen, one Belgian and three Malians were killed in the attack in the capital of Bamako, said Gabriel Toure, director of a local hospital. An additional eight people were wounded, he said. Authorities called the shooting a ""criminal and terrorist act."" ""Mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away (with) the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the Malians,"" the government said in a statement. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. The purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders, Al Akhbar said. ""Al-Murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM),"" according to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm. The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a ""newly-formed"" militant group that has presence in northern Mali. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old. French President Francois Hollande released a statement condemning the attack. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences to the victims' families in a news conference in Paris on Saturday. ""This is an act of cowardice,"" he said. ""But an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end, that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms, wherever it exists."" The French Embassy in Bamako warned its citizens to be on alert if they go out in public. Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years. Fabius said the Malian government was interrogating some suspects. Mali plunged into chaos after soldiers staged a coup three years ago. As a result, Tuareg fighters capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an insurgency that ended with their takeover of the north. After the Tuareg fighters seized the region, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Since then, the nation has battled various rebel factions, mostly in the northern region, with the help of French and African forces. CNN's Brian Walker, Joshua Berlinger and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.","A jihadist group claims responsibility in an audio recording, news agency reports .

"(CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged ""in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. ""The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video."" The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: ""I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse."" Cisse's statement said: ""I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down."" Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been ""disgusting."" ""This is not acceptable,"" he said. ""There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis."" Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: ""Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. ""I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.""

"(CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Libyan oil field, according to officials. Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed ""ISIS militias"" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had ""stepped up coordination"" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities ""to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release."" Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that ""credible sources"" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS ""terrorists."" The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani ""much earlier"" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. ""These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose. He said Philippine authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were ISIS members. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalists Ayman Kekly and Arlene Samson-Espiritu, contributed to this report.","The abducted workers were seized in an attack on an oil field last week .

"(CNN)Think back to your high school's senior prank. Maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside-down. So it's no surprise that Wichita high school Principal Sherman Padgett was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket. ""She didn't say anything about why. She just said 'hold the bucket,' "" the North High School principal told CNN affiliate KWCH. ""I'm not going to hold the bucket unless I have a little inkling of why it could be."" Good thing he changed his mind. Once he did, student after student streamed by, dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket. ""Thank you for making high school the best years of my life,"" one said. ""You've made my first year experience in America one that I will always fondly remember,"" read another. One student recalled how Padgett ""helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy."" The notes were the idea of senior Emily Jones. She decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother. ""Padgett's an awesome principal,"" she said. For Padgett, who has been principal at North since 2006, the experience was priceless. ""Became a little emotional on some of them,"" he said, ""I kind of read them and thought, 'man, this is better than a paycheck. This is why I do the things that I do.'

"(CNN)The search for a comic book artist missing in the Cayman Islands since Thursday is now being called a recovery mission. Norman Lee, an artist for DC and Marvel comics, went missing while snorkeling with his wife off the eastern coast of Grand Cayman, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.

"(CNN)Jessie Usher, the lead of Starz's series ""Survivor's Remorse,"" has been cast in Fox's sequel ""Independence Day 2."" Liam Hemsworth has also been cast in a lead role and Jeff Goldblum will reprise his role as David Levinson from the original. It has been nearly 20 years since the Will Smith-starring sci-fi film hit theaters, grossing more than $800 million worldwide at the box office. Director Roland Emmerich will return to helm the film. ""Independence Day 2"" is set for release on June 24, 2016 — almost exactly 20 years from when the first film hit theaters on July 3, 1996. Dean Devlin, Emmerich and Harald Kloser are producing. Independence Day 2 is a big get for Usher, who will play a central character in the new film as the son of Smith's character. Smith's role in the first blockbuster helped establish him as a star, kicking his career up to the next level. Usher stars in the Lebron James-produced Starz TV series ""Survivor's Remorse"" as Cam Calloway, a basketball player who moves with his family to Atlanta after he signs a pro contract. The first season premiered Oct. 4, 2014, and Starz quickly renewed the show for a second season, which will air later this year. The rising star's film credits includes TriStar football drama When the Game Stands Tall, which hit theaters in August. On the TV side, he previously starred in the Cartoon Network's series Level Up.

"(CNN)Former Vice President Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday after being admitted with influenza, hospital spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein said. ""He's doing well. We treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today,"" she said. Mondale, 87, was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday. ""He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home,"" Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. ""He said tell everybody he is doing well."" Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan. But not before he made history by naming a woman, U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York, as his running mate. Before that, the former lawyer was  a U.S. senator from Minnesota.

"(CNN)The only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound Massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online? People are actually buying it. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says. But not if you live in New England or surrounding states. ""We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast!"" says Waring's website, ShipSnowYo.com. ""We're in the business of expunging snow!"" His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet. With more than 45 total inches, Boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history. Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity. According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston. He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states, and an idea was born. His business slogan: ""Our nightmare is your dream!"" At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination. So this week, Waring began shipping larger amounts in the Styrofoam cubes, which he promises will arrive anywhere in the U.S. in less than 20 hours. He also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $119. Many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag, he said. Whether Waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen. But he has no shortage of product. ""At this rate, it's going to be July until the snow melts,"" he told Boston.com. ""But I've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I'll ship some fall foliage.""","A man in suburban Boston is selling snow online to customers in warmer states .

"(CNN)Farah fled the civil war in Syria with her husband in the middle of the night, hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into Jordan. Two days later, she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status. Like 70,000 other refugees from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and the Palestinian Territories, Farah (her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity) now lives with her family in Zarqa, a poor Jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks. Men dominate public spaces, and many women stay at home, isolated. Two years ago, Farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer. Here, he found work tiling construction sites, but was arrested three times for working illegally. ""Now my husband stays at home, depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps,"" Farah said. She is now the family breadwinner, working at a local organization providing educational programs to Syrian and Jordanian children. Every day she navigates the dangers of Zarqa's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men. Yet Zarqa is also a pocket of hope. Some 384 female refugees working with the Near East Foundation  have been able to re-establish savings, restore dignity, strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives. Many of them choose to become earners for the first time. They belong to a network of Jordanian and refugee women -- coaches, mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support, exchange tips and build friendships. Some 80% of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business. Fatiya, who escaped Iraq during the 2003 invasion, was surviving on charity until six months ago. Now she runs her own leather goods home-based business, making belts, wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home. These days, Fatiya is busy rebuilding her life. ""I make my own way,""she says. Zainab, also an Iraqi refugee, is now a hairdresser in Zarqa. On the side, she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women, walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent. On March 8, we celebrate International Women's Day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who, like Farah, Fatiya and Zainab, continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination, creativity and skill, despite increasingly limited options. Aid agencies must match the strength of these women's resilience. To truly assist them, we must empower them with opportunities and choices. Of the 10.5 million refugees registered with UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, less than 1% are eventually resettled. The rest remain in limbo, forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work. Refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years, and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over. Humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on ""immediate"" aid -- distribution of cash, food and subsistence items. This is unsustainable. UNHCR provides critical cash assistance to refugees in Jordan -- but this can be as little as $71 a month, 16 times below the country's poverty line. Refugees need to supplement their allowances, yet they cannot legally find employment, and working in the informal sector can be dangerous. Farah, Fatiya and Zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy. But their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms, exposing them to heightened abuse and violence. Women's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence. To help this network of women control the income they earn, the Near East Foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives' and daughters' newfound roles. ""In the beginning, these women were tremendously shy -- they didn't talk,"" says Hamdan Eliemat, who heads the Bani Hasan Islamic Society, a community organization supporting the women. He laughs. ""And now they won't stop talking. And we men, now we have to listen."" The international community must advocate for refugees' right to survive. We must ensure that beyond immediate aid, women have access to skill-building, financial resources, social networks and protection from violence and harassment, so they have the chance to build their own futures.","Jina Krause-Vilmar: On International Women's Day, focus on helping refugee women adapt to new lives .

"(CNN)Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. A stunning header from Aritz Aduriz shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive Bilbao. Real piled on the pressure for much of the second half but couldn't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Of more immediate concern to Real boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, however, was his side's lack of cutting edge. ""I think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""We are not finding a way through like we did in the games before. We've only scored one goal, from a penalty, in two games. ""That is the problem we have to fix. We lack efficiency up front."" Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. With the second El Classico fixture of the season against Barcelona only a fortnight away, Ancelotti is looking for a quick fix to his side's attacking inhibitions. However, such worries are of little concern to a Bilbao side celebrating its first win over Real in five years. After a slow start to the season the Basques are now up to eighth position. ""We are very proud of how hard we worked,"" goalscorer Arduriz said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. ""The three points will prove a huge boost."" ""The fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at San Mames earlier in the season."" Bayern Munich continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive Bundesliga title with a come from behind 3-1 victory away to Hannover. Hiroshi Kiyotake gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but Xabi Alonso levelled shortly after. A second half brace from Thomas Muller ensured the Bavarians would increase their league at the top of the Bundesliga to 11 points as second place Wolfsburg fell to a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Elsewhere Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's winning streak came to an end with as Jurgen Klopp's revitalized side were held to a 0-0 draw with Hamburg. Paris Saint Germain returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, for 24 hours at least, with a convincing 4-1 win over Lens at the Parc de Princes. David Luiz opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the Parisian's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore secured the win after Yoann Touzghar had pulled one back deficit for Lens. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday.

"(CNN)Pakistan's highest court Friday ordered the release of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks, calling his detention illegal. Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was not present at Friday's court proceeding. The terror attacks in India left more than 160 people dead in November 2008. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. On Friday, India summoned the Pakistan high commissioner ""to convey our strong feelings about (the) Lakhvi verdict,"" said India's external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. Last year, the court granted Lakhvi bail, a decision the Pakistani government had said it would challenge. Many in India are still angry over the attacks and had criticized the bail decision. ""It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail,"" the nation's home minister, Rajnath Singh, said in December. India executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012. Other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks, which went on for three days.

"(CNN)An officer, responding to reports of a suspicious person, shot and killed an unarmed man who was running around in a metro Atlanta apartment complex naked. The officer fired two shots when the man charged at him, said Cedric Alexander, the public safety director of DeKalb County. But given that the man was not carrying a weapon, the police department immediately turned over the case to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations for an independent probe. ""What I have requested here [is] a result of what's going on currently across this country as it relates to police shootings,"" Alexander told reporters. The officer was white; the deceased man was African-American, Alexander said. The incident took place Monday afternoon at an apartment complex in Chamblee, a suburb of Atlanta. Someone called 911 to report a man ""acting deranged, knocking on doors and crawling around naked,"" Alexander said. When the officer arrived, the man charged at him, Alexander said. ""The officer called him to stop while stepping backward, drew his weapon and fired two shots,"" he said. The man, struck twice in the upper body, died. Police later learned he was a resident at the complex. ""I can only reasonably assume that if he was running around the apartment  complex naked, I believe we can make the assumption there may have been some mental health experience that he might have been having,"" Alexander said. DeKalb County police officers undergo some degree of training on how to deal with the mentally ill. But this, and other incidents, highlight the need for more, the public safety director said. ""That's becoming more and more apparent,"" Alexander said. ""We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how to expand our mental health training when we find it certainly necessary to do so. Because it appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who appear to be in distress."" Police did not release the officer's name, but said the seven-year veteran was placed on administrative leave. During the incident, the officer had access to his stun gun and pepper spray, Alexander said.  Why he chose to draw his weapon will come out during the investigation. ""I think in all fairness we need to wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is because I can't tell you, beyond what I have told you so far, what kind of measures that officer may have taken,"" he said. As fatal police shootings come under increased scrutiny in the current climate, police departments also appear to be more forthcoming in proactively releasing information for transparency's sake. Such is the case in Madison, Wisconsin, where Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about the shooting death of  19-year-old Tony Robinson at the hands of an officer. And it seems to be the case in this DeKalb County incident. ""If you look at the state in this country and the things we're going through right now across this country with police-involved shooting, certainly it's a concern to many Americans. And there has certainly been recommendations that have been made in regards to moving towards more independent type of investigations,"" he said.","Police: Officer fired two shots when the man charged at him .

"London (CNN)A photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near London has gone viral on Twitter, with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image. It was first posted by photographer Jason Ward on Monday and credited to Martin Le-May. After #WeaselPecker gained momentum, British media soon picked up the story, and television channel ITV interviewed Le-May. The amateur photographer from Essex, near London, told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in Hornchurch Country Park, Essex, when they heard ""a distressed squawking"" noise and spotted the woodpecker. ""Just after I switched from my binoculars to my camera the bird flew across us and slightly in our direction; suddenly it was obvious it had a small mammal on its back and this was a struggle for life,"" Le-May said. Eventually, Le-May told ITV, the weasel -- known as a ""least weasel"" in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away. Marina Pacheco, chief executive of Britain's Mammal Society told CNN the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker. ""Weasels will go for anything that looks like food -- they've got a high metabolism and they've got to eat a lot,"" she said. ""It doesn't surprise me that a weasel took a punt -- I've seen a photo of a weasel charging a group of sparrows, they're very hungry animals."" But she said the weasel, which would generally try to break the neck of its prey to subdue it, may have exceeded its abilities in this case. ""I think it was a bit of a long shot -- it looks like it tried to grab the neck of the woodpecker to break it,"" Pacheco said. ""I think that it probably doesn't have a big enough jaw to bite through the spine of the woodpecker."" Weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers, Pacheco said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger. But the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects. ""If the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel,"" she said. ""They're quite gung-ho little creatures."" The pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on Twitter, with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by Russian President Vladimir Putin, popstar Miley Cyrus, football star John Terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a Darth Vader costume. (Update: Twitter has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda. Sorry, Darth!) As for the bird? The green woodpecker is also known as a ""yaffle"" for its laughing call. After the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off, we can only hope it lives up to its nickname.","A photo of a green woodpecker flying with a weasel on its back has gone viral on Twitter .

"(Rolling Stone)Kanye West fans are used to seeing thousand-dollar price tags attached to the rapper's Air Yeezy sneakers when they're put up for sale on eBay, but the auction site is now being overrun by sellers offering up plastic bags full of air allegedly captured at West's concerts. The gag started Friday when one ambitious seller attempted to sell a Zipperseal bag with ""Air From Kanye Show,"" with 90 bidders driving the price tag to over $60,000, the Telegraph reports.

"(CNN)The flight crew of the Delta Air Lines plane that skidded into a fence at LaGuardia Airport last week cited brake issues during the landing, according to an update on Monday from the NTSB. The crew said they did not sense any deceleration from the wheel brake upon landing, despite the auto brakes being set to ""max,"" according to an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The runway appeared all white in the moments before landing, according to the report. They based their decision to land after receiving a brake action report of ""good"" from air traffic control, the NTSB said. ""The automatic spoilers did not deploy,"" the crew told the NTSB, ""but that the first officer quickly deployed them manually."" The captain said he was unable to stop the aircraft from drifting left, according to the report. The Boeing MD-88 sustained significant damage to the left wing, flight spoilers, the nose of the plane and the left wing fuel tank, according to the NTSB. Delta Flight 1086 departed from Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later. The aircraft briefly circled New York because of issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. The plane slid off the runway with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Twenty three passengers received minor injuries, and others were transported to the hospital for evaluation. An NTSB meteorologist is examining the weather conditions at the time of the accident, said the report. The cause of the accident has not been determined.","Delta Air Lines Flight 1086 skidded into a fence last week at a LaGuardia Airport beset by winter weather .

"(CNN)More than 100 schools in Pakistan have been renamed in honor of the children killed in a Taliban siege at a Peshawar school last year. According to the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 107 local schools now bear the name of a student killed during the December 16 attack on the Army Public School. Government spokesman Mushtaq Ghani told CNN that the gesture was a way to remember the bravery of the students who were taking exams in an auditorium  when Taliban militants strapped with explosives laid siege. Some six hours later, 145 were dead, 132 of them children, according to authorities. In February, Pakistani authorities arrested a suspect, accusing him of commanding the attack. The Army Public School is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar.

"(CNN)NASCAR announced Wednesday that it has lifted its suspension of driver Kurt Busch, making him eligible to return to the sport immediately -- albeit ""under indefinite probation."" Busch was suspended after a Delaware civil court found that he probably committed domestic violence against his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll. She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. ""As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,"" Busch said then. ""I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life."" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year. NASCAR officials decided to lift Busch's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit's reinstatement program, completed behavioral assessments and got the OK from a behavioral health care expert to race again. He's not totally out of the woods. In a news release, NASCAR said Busch must ""undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized."" Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said the lack of charges against Busch expedited his return. ""We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his off-track behavior,"" O'Donnell said. CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.","The lack of charges against Busch expedited the decision, a NASCAR official says .

"Kuala Lumpur (CNN)The initial hours after the disappearance of flight MH370 were characterized by confusion and chaos, as air traffic controllers struggled to comprehend the situation and radar operators failed to take notice, according to data contained in an interim report. The report -- released one year after the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew --- provides a detailed picture of delays and protocol violations before the launch of the search and rescue. An astonishing five hours and 13 minutes passed between the last communication from the flight crew and Kuala Lumpur's first distress signal concerning the missing plane. And it was another five hours before the first search flights took off to try to find it. CNN's aviation correspondent Richard Quest said he believes the delayed response was the most disturbing thing revealed by the interim report -- ""the lack of somebody pushing the big red button that says crisis and panic."" A year later after the plane's disappearance, not a single trace of Flight MH370 has been found despite extensive search efforts. Investigators believe the wreckage lies somewhere on the bottom of the Indian Ocean, based on the analysis of satellite communications data. The first sign that something was wrong with flight MH370 came after plane failed to check in with Vietnamese Air Traffic Controllers after leaving Malaysian airspace. According to protocol, Ho Chi Minh ATC should have informed their Kuala Lumpur counterparts (KL ATCC) about this within five minutes. Instead they waited 20. When Ho Chi Minh finally did inform Kuala Lumpur, the confusion was evident, as seen in transcripts of the conversation released Sunday. KL ATCC asked three times at what point Ho Chi Minh lost contact, then went on to express concern at the delay, asking ""Why you didn't tell me first? Within five minutes you should be (sic) called me."" The confusion only got worse after Malaysia Airlines mistakenly told Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Controllers they could see the flight somewhere over Cambodia. It took an hour and a half to clear this up, after Malaysia Airlines admitted to controllers they were only looking at the projected flight track. Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said the misinformation was a momentary lapse by a company employee. ""Our information was only to be as a guide. We are not an ATC per se. We don't have radar,"" he told CNN. The watch supervisor then waited another two hours to activate the rescue coordination center. Still another hour went by before before Kuala Lumpur issued the distress signal. No explanation for the delay is given in the interim report, which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations. After the air traffic controllers lost contact with MH370, the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries. Yet little seems to have been done with the data in the immediate hours after the plane disappeared. The interim report says that ""for unknown reasons"" Indonesia's Medan Radar did not see the flight. And Thailand ""did not pay much attention,"" since MH370's flight path did not fall within its borders. Malaysian military radar tracked the flight for an additional hour, including its turn back across the Malay Peninsula. Despite this information, search and rescue teams did not begin expanding the search area for a full day. Though the interim report makes no mention of it, a failure by the Malaysian military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame. A briefing document prepared by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of MH370 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours. CNN approached Malaysia's Ministry of Defence for comment but is yet to receive a response . Another working document notes that MH370's turn back might have been discovered much earlier, if the military and non-military agencies had coordinated better. ""In essence, a week or more was lost in the initial search because of poor civil/military cooperation,"" reads the ICAO working document. The interim report released by Malaysian investigators on Sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities. It's impossible to know if a speedier response from air traffic controllers, or more immediate access to radar data, would have changed the course of events for MH370. But it would have provided authorities with more time, either to track the flight or to search the ocean before the batteries died in the emergency locator beacons. Looking back at the series of miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the radar lapses also provides valuable lessons that could help future search and rescue operations. Though the MH370 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report, it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead. Journalist Chan Kok Leong contributed to this report.","Interim report exposes delays and inaction after MH370 disappeared .

"Naypyidaw, Myanmar (CNN)Twenty-one people are dead and 21 missing after a ferry capsized in the Southeast Asia nation of Myanmar. Myanmar's Ministry of Information said in a statement that the ship capsized Friday night as it sailed, in bad weather conditions, around the city of Sittwe. That's when a large wave crashed into the ferry, causing it capsize near Myaybone and Myaukkyine islands. Authorities have managed to rescue at least 167 people, according to the information ministry for Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. Pictures from the government showed rescue workers helping people off a boat onto the land. Sittwe is the capital of Rakhine state and sits on the Bay of Bengal, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) from the Bangladesh border. This weekend's weather forecast for the city calls for some clouds giving way to clear skies, with high daytime temperatures expected to be in the 30s Celsius (80s to 90s Fahrenheit). Fatal ferry disasters are nothing new to the region. Last month, at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the Padma River north of neighboring Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials said. A cargo vessel hit the ferry, causing it to overturn and trapping passengers on its lower deck. Forty-five people died in an accident on the same river in August. In May 2013, several boats carrying as many as 150 people were thought to have capsized near Myanmar's western coast ahead of a storm approaching the area. Those boats were carrying Rohingya, members of Myanmar's long-suffering Muslim minority, Thailand-based U.N. official Kirsten Mildren said at the time. Journalist Manny Muang reported from Myanmar, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","167 people have been rescued, Myanmar's government says .

"(CNN)Myanmar warplanes fighting rebels dropped a bomb at a sugarcane field in China, killing four civilians, the latter's state media reported Saturday. In addition to the fatalities, nine others were wounded, according to Xinhua news agency. Shortly after the incident Friday, China sent fighter jets to patrol over their shared border. The jets are there to ""track, monitor, warn and chase away"" Myanmar military planes, China's air force told state media. China summoned Myanmar's ambassador in Beijing after the incident in the border city of Lincang. Liu Zhenmin, the vice foreign minister for China, called on Myanmar to investigate and bring those behind the attack to justice. Myanmar forces have been battling ethnic separatist rebels in the rugged border region across from Yunnan province. In recent incidents, stray gunfire has damaged property on the Chinese side of the border, prompting Beijing to warn Myanmar to ensure safety. There was no immediate reaction from Myanmar.","China sends fighter jets to patrol over border with Myanmar following the incident .

"(CNN)When I was a child, a pale specter used to call our house most evenings, eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns. We called her the ""White Bread Lady,"" a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread. She wasn't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread. No, she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision. Although we all laughed at the time, it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame. Because most of us (including if not particularly the illustrious Ehrlich family) have lurking within us our very own ""White Bread Lady,"" ready to convince us that each cough, sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health. And, naturally, that White Bread Lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information. Yup, so quoth Google, we all have cancer. According to the Pew Research Center, 80% of Internet users have looked up health information online. While that practice can be beneficial in some respects, the abundance of (variably valid) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs. (Or, worse, can lead us to neglect getting the care we need.) Read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online. Searching blind . Your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall, twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair. You type ""eye twitch"" into Google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open, revealing to you wonders untold. You are the chosen one. Too bad that this trove of ""medical information"" is actually some dude's fan-fiction site. Sure, the above is an extreme example, but, as Dr. Kevin Pho of KevinMD.com pointed out, ""There's a lot of bad information on the Web and information that can be dangerous."" Especially if you're not considering who put up that information in the first place. Pho urges users to favor Web addresses ending in .org and .edu when looking for reputable health-care info, and to check who is funding the collection of that information. ""There's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the Web,"" he said. He suggests turning to sites like Mayo Clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors (like Pho's own website) when trolling the web for info. And, of course, if a site mentions trolls and third eyes, one should definitely press on. Flailing in forums . If there's one thing people like to do online, it's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies' various and sundry discharges. That's all well and good; sharing experiences with others is enriching! Unless the people you're sharing with are idiots. ""You can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really isn't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close,"" warned Craig Monsen, co-founder of symptom-checker app SymCat. On the other hand, ""sometimes you'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem, and their solution does help."" ""Health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms,"" added Dr. Natasha Burgert of KC Kids Doc. ""I think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community."" The trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you. And, you know, if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach, maybe click off and see a doc. Getting emotional . You know that game ""6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon""? There should seriously be a version of that called ""6 Degrees of Cancer"" -- as in, when looking up your symptoms online, how long does it take to deduce that you have a life-threatening disease instead of, say, a simple cold? According to Burgert, the root of this whole ""worst-case scenario"" thing is getting too emotional. ""For most intents and purposes, when you're looking for online health information, it's about yourself or a family member,"" she said. ""When you're looking through that lens, it's very hard to keep emotional distance. So you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that's the path you'll continue down, whether it's correct or not."" Burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to ""understand possible diagnoses, find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home."" SymCat and Mayo Clinic's symptom checker let you type in what you're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor's aid. Your doctor's website might also have such a tool. Voila, you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees. Keeping mum around MDs . ""I think, traditionally, many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the Internet,"" Pho said. ""But I think more and more doctors are accepting it. Personally, I think that transparency of information is helpful in a way."" Translation: Help your doctor help you. If you're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what's ailing you, share that info with your physician. ""I really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online, because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns,"" Burgert said. ""People get scared when they get sick and hurt, and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves. The Internet adds to that physician's expertise in order to do that."" Remember, though, knowing how to use the Internet doesn't make you a doctor. Google doesn't count as a second opinion. If you're unhappy with your doc's diagnosis, go get one the traditional way. Putting off the inevitable . If your ailment isn't going away, all the symptom-checking and Mayo Clinic-ing in the world isn't going to help you. Make a doctor's appointment. Like, right now. Sites like ZocDoc make it super easy (and free; doctors pay to be listed) to set up an appointment ASAP, so no whining that you'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then ""it"" will have gone away. Unless, of course, ""it"" is that white bread you just ate. In that case, please stop calling my dad.","According to a Pew report, 80% of Internet users have looked up health info online .

"(CNN)A grand jury in Clark County, Nevada, has indicted a 19-year-old man accused of fatally shooting his neighbor in front of her house last month. Erich Nowsch Jr. faces charges of murder with a deadly weapon, attempted murder and firing a gun from within a car. Police say Nowsch shot Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home February 12. Nowsch's attorney, Conrad Claus, has said his client will argue self-defense. The Meyers family told police that Tammy Meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson when there was a confrontation with the driver of another car. Tammy Meyers drove home and sent her inside to get her brother, Brandon, who allegedly brought a 9mm handgun. Tammy Meyers and her son then went back out, police said. They encountered the other car again, and there was gunfire, police said. Investigators found casings from six .45-caliber rounds at that scene. Nowsch's lawyer said after his client's first court appearance that Brandon Meyers pointed a gun before anyone started shooting. He said the family's story about a road-rage incident and what reportedly followed don't add up. After zipping away from the first shooting, Tammy Meyers drove home and the other car, a silver Audi, went there also. Police said Nowsch shot at both Tammy and Brandon Meyers. Tammy Meyers was hit in the head and died two days later at a hospital. Brandon Meyers, who police said returned fire at the home, was not injured. The driver of the silver Audi has yet to be found by authorities. That suspect wasn't named in Thursday's indictment. Nowsch was arrested five days after the killing in his family's house, just one block away from the Meyers' home. He is due in court Tuesday for a preliminary hearing.","Erich Nowsch will face three charges, including first-degree murder .

"(CNN)With the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager Tony Robinson in Madison, Wisconsin, the racist chanting of fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma, and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, it's safe to say that the always-strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point. And the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve. To approach things from a more positive angle, the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative. The best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse. This unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems, which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them. When things are going wrong, responsible people can begin by saying the right things. President Obama said on Twitter, ""Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together."" The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying, ""The CBC understands the frustrations in Ferguson, but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country."" And Attorney General Eric Holder noted, ""This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. ... This was a damn punk, a punk who was trying to sow discord."" For the most part, authorities in Missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters. Surely, not all responses have been as measured, but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people. While we pause for a moment to let passions cool, we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual recrimination. The way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community's real concerns. And it's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces. This approach would benefit both the community and the police. I'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations, as noted in the DOJ report on Ferguson. Nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent. One of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats. Officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass. Being encased in a vehicle alienates a person from the world around them. The cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies, he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve. Another idea is to give cops bicycles, which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community. Lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the DOJ report on Ferguson. In areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide, mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together. After all, both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods. Both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level.  A tech services company in the South Bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood. The event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like ""basically they're like us."" Ultimately, police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike. Communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations. New Orleans Police Det. Winston Harbin became a minor Internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during Mardi Gras. Besides just being fun, Harbin's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing. Fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism, unequal treatment, bias, subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity. It is times like now, when that anger and resentment are boiling, that we address it. With the right approach, we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from ""HandsUpDon'tShoot"" to ""HandsTogetherInTrust.""","Latest Ferguson shootings push strained race relations to breaking point .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)The North Korean ambassador in Bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy's diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms (59 pounds) of undeclared gold into the country's main airport in Dhaka, according to officials in Bangladesh. North Korean officials could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident. Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin, a top official in Bangladesh's customs agency, told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th, after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight. Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying ""illegal items."" ""It was very tough. We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat,"" Ziauddin said, referring to the Vienna Convention, which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity. He said the suspect, whom he identified as Son Young Nam, the first secretary of North Korea's embassy in Dhaka, initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched. ""He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag,"" Ziauddin said. ""At first he said 'This is an electric motor.'  After further questioning he changed his mind and told us, 'These are cipher machines and very confidential.'"" Eventually, customs officers opened the diplomat's bag and found the undeclared goods, that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments. At current market prices, the gold would be valued at around $1 million. Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country's customs regulations. An official with Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador. It's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds. Due to international sanctions, North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems. ""It would be interesting to see if [the diplomat] is disciplined when he gets back"" to North Korea, said John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies. ""That would be a way of saying whether or not he's a corrupt diplomat."" According to the Foreign Secretary's office in Bangladesh, the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country. CNN's K.J.

"(CNN)The father of baby Lily, found by rescuers after her mother's car flipped into a river, says she's doing great and that he feels blessed. Rescuers found the toddler Saturday hanging upside down in the car, which had crashed into a frigid Utah river a day before. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25. Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. ""(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home."" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. ""She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,"" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe.

"(WIRED)Screens are rectangles. Even the 3-year-old playing with your iPad could tell you that. But what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame? Say... a circular one? Monohm, a startup based in Berkeley, California, was founded around this very idea. For the last year, the three-person team has been working a circular, palm-sized device dubbed Runcible. They cheekily refer to it as the ""anti-smartphone,"" a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system. The round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed-obsessed, notification-saturated digital existence. It's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents. That's a quixotic dream, but an interesting one. Display technologies have a long and rectangular history. Before smartphones there were movie screens, TVs, and computers, not to mention paintings and pages of print. And then of course there are windows—in some ways the original glass rectangles. In each case, the rectangle's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality. Whether you're talking about film or glass or stone, rectangles are easy to make. They don't leave much wasted material. As frames for shaping the world, however, different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects. 14 of the Best Architecture Photos From the Past Year . In her book The Virtual Window, which traces the rectangular frame from Renaissance painting up through Microsoft Windows, media theorist Anne Friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture, centering on a public feud between French builder August Perret and the preeminent modernist architect Le Corbusier. Perret was a strong advocate of the traditional French casement window, which was oriented vertically. Its main function, he said, was to let light into a room. Le Corbusier, making use of new manufacturing techniques, designed his buildings around long, horizontal windows, which were as much about framing the outside world as illuminating the space within. The disagreement influenced architecture for decades to come. The simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space. Rectangles are still subtly dictating our behavior today. Movie screens, chased by TVs, have gotten bigger and wider, encouraging us to sit back and lose ourselves in the spectacle. (In 1930, Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein lamented how the cinema's ""passive horizontalism."" He wanted the screen to be square.) Smartphones, with their slender, touch-controlled displays, have become a distinctly more active rectangle. Paired with the never-ending vertical feeds that fill apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, they've become an irresistible, inexhaustible diversion. The point is this: Frames matter. They suggest certain things about how we should approach them. They shape the type of stuff that's made for them. And if just turning a rectangle on its side can make such a big difference, imagine all the interesting things that might happen if you left the rectangle behind altogether. Runcible isn't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative. ""I think we've become really, really good at getting interrupted and creating conduits for interruption,"" says Monohm CEO Aubrey Anderson, who met his co-founders during a stint at Apple. ""It's time now to use technology to get a little quieter."" If miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone, Runcible asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch. And the shape of the device is central to that thinking. A circular frame, after all, is no good for browsing a Twitter feed. 12 Most Ancient and Magnificent Trees From Around the World . So what is it good for? That's the question. At this point, Runcible as much a provocation as an actual product. The three-person team, which has been working with the San Francisco design studio Box Clever on the concept for nearly a year, has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system, but they've still got a long way to go. They've got a few vague ideas for applications. One is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts. Another is a compass-style mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure A-to-B efficiency. But they're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all: They want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction, software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today. All this is easier said than done, of course. Throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ain't easy. Plus, it's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with. Smartphones are distracting, sure, but they're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff. Still, even as a hint of a possible device, Runcible is compelling. For one thing, the company's hardware model feels great in the hand (The team's hardware guy, George Arriola, came from Sony, where he helped design the PlayStation 4.) The model's curved back brings to mind the very first iPhone—and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold. And though unformed, the vision for the software is interesting too. If today's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there's always more stuff just outside the frame, circles could offer something more self-contained, more complete. Maybe even something actively inefficient. Rectangles are beautiful and functional. Circles are zen. A circular device would sever the link to the printed page, the TV and the computer, and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration. Pocket watches and compasses. Microscopes and telescopes. Peep holes, port holes, and wormholes. Dials, buttons, and other circular controls. 15 Incredible Photos That'll Remind You to Be Awed by Planet Earth . If nothing else, the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices. Maybe thinking about circles could help us make our rectangles better. Runcible is just one scrappy, literal attempt to abandon the rectangle. But similar thinking is happening elsewhere. Android Wear, Google's smartwatch operating system, reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display. Apple Watch is in some ways another rectangle, but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new, less rectangular thinking. (Note how its home screen ditches iPhone's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones. Also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds). We've seen how sensors can be harnessed to choreograph experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely, as with Disney's Magic Bands, which usher you through the company's parks. And then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality, where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely. Here, the screen is less of a window, more of a lens. The only frame is your field of vision. Rectangles will endure. They're easy, they're efficient. But as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms, we'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce. Just recently, in fact, we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way. In a 10 minute video, Google proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of tent-like structures draped in glass. These buildings don't have vertical windows or horizontal windows. They're nothing but windows, or maybe they're so radical that the concept of ""window"" doesn't even really apply. Whatever the case, there's nothing rectangular about them, and Google's convinced they're the future. Read more from WIRED: .

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN)Suicide bombers attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Sunday, setting off two blasts that killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, officials said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the deadly attack and warned of more to come. The explosions, which struck the Nishtar Colony area in the city of Lahore, wounded at least 78 people, said Dr. Muhammed Saeed Sohbin, medical superintendent at Lahore General Hospital. Video from the scene aired by CNN affiliate GEO News showed twisted metal, shattered glass and panicked residents outside a church compound. Ambulance and security personnel were seen moving in. Later footage showed water cannons arriving to disperse the crowd. Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said by telephone that his group was responsible for the suicide bombings, declaring that such attacks would continue until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. After a period of disunity, the terrorist group's three major splinter groups announced last week that they were joining forces again under the name Tehrik-i-Taliban, or TTP. The Pakistani military has been waging a campaign against the militant group in North Waziristan, one of the loosely governed tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose government held unsuccessful peace talks with the TTP last year, strongly condemned Sunday's attack, according to a statement from his office. Sharif asked provincial governments to tighten security and ""take all possible measures"" to protect people and property, the statement said. The last major attack on Pakistan's Christian community took place in 2013, when suicide bombers struck a church in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing more than 80 people. More recently, a Christian couple were burned to death in November by mob that accused them of blasphemy. ""The Christian community is a soft target for militant outfits in Pakistan,"" said Rabia Mehmood, a researcher at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank. ""But generally Christians and other religious minorities are under a constant threat by the extremist elements in the society and rampant religious intolerance."" On Sunday, Pope Francis said he learned of the attacks ""with pain, with much pain."" He called for peace in Pakistan and said that persecution of Christians doesn't get the attention it deserves. The Pope prayed that ""this persecution against Christians, which the world tries to hide, might end, and that there be peace."" Other minorities in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation have also been targeted this year. Last month, an attack on a Shiite mosque in Peshawar killed at least 19 worshipers and injured dozens of others. The Pakistani Taliban reportedly claimed responsibility for that attack, too. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Karachi, Pakistan, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Brian Walker and journalists Saleem Mehsud and Adeel Raja contributed to this report.","The Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for the suicide bombings .

"(CNN)They are very convincing when they call. They have a Washington phone number and can cite your financial history down to the cent. They say you're under investigation, in danger of losing your home, or worse, your freedom -- unless you pay thousands of dollars on the spot. But they're not real.  And you're not in trouble.  Not unless you take it seriously.  This is a scam. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. A big one. Federal authorities say it's the largest IRS impersonation scam they've ever seen -- swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013. ""They have information that only the Internal Revenue Service would know about you,"" said Timothy Camus, deputy inspector general for investigations with the Treasury Department. ""It's a byproduct of today's society. There's so much information available on individuals."" Using identity theft technology, the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years, although the Treasury Department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. Camus said they've recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers, and it's increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week. Authorities believe the thieves are operating out of India, using phishing technology to make it appear they're IRS agents in Washington. Call 1: 'The IRS is filing a lawsuit against you' Call 2: 'Your address is under state investigation' The Federal Trade Commission, which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint, and the Treasury Department, which leads the criminal probe, both have open investigations. The largest loss reported was a staggering $500,000, Camus said. Most have lost about $5,000. One of those victims was former NFL player Frank Garcia, who is now a sports radio host in Charlotte, North Carolina. When he got the call, it sounded so authentic, he left the radio station in a panic, scramming to get the money they wanted. 12 scams to avoid . ""The only thing running through my head is, I'm going to jail. I'm gonna be on television, in handcuffs, for tax evasion,"" he recalled. ""I had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. That the authorities had been contacted and in fact, they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes."" Garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around Charlotte, depositing $500 each time into a PayPal account set up by the woman on the phone. He ended up losing about $4,000. He, and other victims, told CNN the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone. ""I have never been arrested in my life and was very scared,"" said Kin Ko, a New Jersey resident who lost about $5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison, and the IRS was about to confiscate his assets: His car, his house and all the money in his bank account. The person had a badge number, read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction. The thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. They harness stolen identities and use programs such as Google Earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money. ""It sounded as legitimate as could be,"" said Al Cadenhead, a pastor in North Carolina who also fell victim. ""They knew where I was. He told me where to go -- to the Rite Aid, up two streets turn left to the Rite Aid. The names of the streets, it was really just incredible."" Cadenhead told CNN he didn't come to his senses until he'd signed over $16,000. Identity theft tops list of consumer complaints . ""It was like I came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business,"" he said. ""I know other people who've heard the story say 'How did a guy with a PhD fall victim?' I was the perfect victim. I've never been audited, never paid a traffic ticket. I don't know how to pay fines. How do I know they aren't stern and serious about everything?"" Camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the IRS, so they do whatever the caller says. In December, federal authorities found and arrested two U.S.-based ""runners"" who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts. In many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. Ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money. If you think you have been a victim of an IRS impersonation scam, you can report it to TIGTA's web site or call 800-366-4484. For Frank Garcia, the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8,000 after he thought his debt had been paid. He says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest -- which, of course, never came. How hackers are stealing your tax refund . ""I felt taken advantage of. I felt small. And I was naive,"" he said. ""I wasn't aware. I didn't understand the system. And didn't blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things."" Often, Camus says, immigrants are targeted and threatened with deportation. The elderly are also a popular target, although the scam has grown so large, people of all ages, income levels and status are getting these calls. Treasury Department officials say if you get one of these calls, the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up. Camus himself, a Treasury Department investigator, even got one.

"(CNN)The attempts by some in the GOP to undermine President Barack Obama's Iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary. First, the Republican leadership invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress without consulting the White House, and he duly warned against softening of the West's line on Iran. Now, 47 senators have written an open letter to the Iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with Obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election. It is an astonishing move. But this is not, strictly speaking, unique. People in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past. Back in 1983, Sen. Edward Kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the Soviet Union -- effectively sidestepping President Ronald Reagan. Working through proxies, he suggested that he visit Moscow to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the American people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation. As Washington Post journalist Vincent Bzdek notes in his book ""The Kennedy Legacy,"" this occurred close to a U.S. presidential election, and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy. One might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals: He had a clear record of campaigning to reduce Cold War tensions and thought Reagan was mishandling the Soviets. On more than one occasion, Kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the Senate. In my book on the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries, I note that Kennedy opposed Jimmy Carter's hard-line stance on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan -- a position that was well-intentioned, prophetic and somewhat advantageous to Kennedy's campaign for the Democratic nomination. But it's not only Democrats who have done that. Step forward, Richard Nixon. In 1968, the presidential election looked close. With the Johnson administration edging toward a peace deal in Vietnam, Nixon's team rolled the dice. According to an account in Politico, Anna Chennault, a Republican activist, was given a message to pass onto the South Vietnamese government: If they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn, the Democrats would lose the election and Nixon as the next president would offer them better terms. The South Vietnamese indeed proved intransigent, and the Republicans won the White House. No evidence exists directly tying Nixon personally to the conspiracy, but we now know for sure that it happened and it's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge. There is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 GOP efforts look tame by comparison. The extreme lengths that Kennedy and Nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority. It's true that the spirit of the Constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the President. But such harmony hasn't always been possible. Recall that Congress and the Carter White House tore themselves apart over the Panama Canal Treaties. That the Reagan administration's policy in Nicaragua was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels, and the then-Democratic House speaker, Jim Wright, was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left-wing government. That Bill Clinton's 1994 nuclear deal with North Korea was criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Or that liberal Democrats did their best to defund the Iraq War. As Damian Paletta writes, foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the White House through executive agreements that pass without comment. But the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is naïve, and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate. The particular matter of the Iran talks is sensitive for the Republicans because it involves the electoral holy trinity of Obama, Israel and the presidential primaries. They weren't going to walk away from this one, and we can hardly be surprised that they haven't. The Democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed, as they have many times in the past. In a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power, with a competitive two-party system bolted on to keep its politics fluid, this was arguably inevitable.","Timothy Stanley: GOP senators' letter to Iranian leaders seems extraordinary .

"(CNN)Pope Francis, who succeeded a resigning pontiff exactly two years ago, told a Mexican television network Friday that he expects his pontificate will be brief. ""Four or five years,"" he told Televisa. ""I do not know, even two or three. Two have already passed. It is a somewhat vague sensation. Maybe it's like the psychology of the gambler who convinces himself he will lose, so he won't be disappointed and if he wins, is happy. I do not know."" Francis, who was elected in March 2013 after Pope Benedict XVI stepped down, said his predecessor had reopened a door to more popes emeritus. When asked whether he likes being Pope, he enthusiastically responded: ""I do not mind."" Francis, 78, said he feels God only wanted him to lead the Roman Catholic Church for a short time ""and nothing more."" He said that he would not support putting an age limit on the papacy. He also enjoys calling on the Pope Emeritus. ""It's like having a wise grandfather at home. One can seek advice,"" Francis said. Francis made similar retirement comments in August when he praised Benedict for ""his beautiful gesture"" and said he might do the same thing one day. He told Televisa he misses the ability to go out in public without attracting a huge crowd. ""I would like ... to go out one day, without being recognized, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza,"" he said.

He offered to give a social media shout-out to the first business where he found a diapering table in the men's room. The post had logged more than 230,000 comments as of Wednesday morning. Lots of folks offered up places Kutcher should patronize, such as Walmart and Cracker Barrel, where they say changing tables abound.

"(CNN)Closed for over a decade, a trail that's been described as ""the world's most dangerous path"" will no longer be off limits to the public thanks to a massive reconstruction project. Due to reopen March 26, Spain's stunning Caminito del Rey features a cliff face boardwalk that hangs 100 meters above the Guadalhorce River. The trail, which begins in the village of El Chorro in southern Malaga province, has been around since the early 1900s, originally built to provide access to two waterfalls for hydroelectric workers. Over the years, the boardwalk deteriorated and, following a string of fatal accidents in 1999 and 2000, the government demolished the access points to the walkway. The reopening, which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off, coincides with Spain's annual Holy Week celebrations. According to the Spanish daily El Pais, the provincial government allocated 5.5 million euros ($5.8 million) to the project. The entire route is 7.7 kilometers long, with boardwalks covering 2.9 kilometers of the trail. The most famous section includes the Balconcillo de los Gaitanes bridge, which spans the Gaitanes Gorge. Tourism officials say it takes between four and five hours to walk the entire route, which includes some steep slopes. Entry will be free for the first six months after the attraction reopens on March 26. Visiting hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. from April 1 to October 31, and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. from November 1 to March 31.

"(CNN)Outside of Israeli politics, Isaac Herzog is not a well-known name. That may change on March 17, when Israelis head to the polls for election day. In the final round of polling before the elections, Herzog's Zionist Union party is in the lead, holding a four-seat edge over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party. ""I believe in a certain type of leadership that is not always customary in this region. I'm not a general. I don't give orders. I know how to work together,"" he says. Throughout the campaign, Herzog has been seen as an underdog, lacking the charisma and the English fluency of Netanyahu. Herzog says that doesn't bother him at all. ""I have always suffered from a certain underestimation,"" Herzog said, ""and I have always surprised."" He promised, ""I will surprise again, and I will show my leadership and stamina."" Herzog began his political career in 2003, when he first won a seat in the Knesset with the Labor Party. He held a variety of ministerial positions, including minister of housing and construction, minister of tourism, and minister of welfare and social services, before becoming leader of the Labor Party in 2013. In those elections, he also became the leader of the opposition, as Benjamin Netanyahu won another term as prime minister. But when Netanyahu called for early elections in 2014, Herzog pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform. ""What I run for is social justice. I will change the nature of the division of wealth in a fair and more balanced way, close inequality and give a sense of purpose to the people here in the workplace, in the housing, and in the cost of living,"" promised Herzog. Before the election, the issue of a nuclear Iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the White House and Netanyahu. Herzog, in a speech almost immediately after Netanyahu's address to Congress, promised to work with the United States and European powers, not against, to ensure the safety of Israel. He echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN's Elise Labott. ""A nuclear-armed Iran is dangerous to world peace, is dangerous to our region, is dangerous to Israel. As leader of Israel, I will never accept a nuclear-armed Iran. Never. And all options are on the table."" In these elections, negotiations with the Palestinians haven't been one of the major issues, but Herzog promised to restart the stalled peace talks with the Palestinian Authority. ""I will do my best to ignite a political process with our Palestinian neighbors. ... Although I cannot promise 100% results, I promise 100% effort."" Herzog comes from Israeli political royalty. His grandfather, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was the first chief rabbi of the state of Israel. His father, Chaim Herzog, was an Army general, an ambassador to the United Nations and the president of Israel. Herzog believes it is his destiny to be the next prime minister of Israel. ""What I carry with me is a unique legacy, a family legacy, but most important, an experience that brings me to be able to lead our nation.""","Polls show Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union party four seats ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's party .

If it were just one of those things, maybe we wouldn't be seeing this kind of turnout because Brazilians have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in October. But it's all come to a head. Political corruption -- let's break that down. What's the scandal about? Petrobras is the national oil company. It's one of the most powerful, richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world. It was very respected. People invested in it. Rousseff, who won election in October by a slim margin, was -- before becoming President -- the chairwoman of Petrobras' board of directors. She was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to Petrabras executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from Petrobras. In early March, the country's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians, many of them from the President's ruling Workers' Party and the speakers of the House and Senate. But Rousseff hasn't been accused of anything, right? Right. She's not being investigated. Protesters' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing, because she's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely. But, the public perception is that even if she didn't personally profit for this scheme, she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable. Has she responded to the protesters? She has. What she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she's rooting it out. As proof, she contends, she's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company. It's important to know that the Petrobras scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said over and over that she would root out corruption. It's also interesting that she isn't lashing out at protesters. She is saying she won't put up with violence -- and so far the protests haven't gotten violent. But she says that Brazil is a democratic country and people have the right to protest. She comes from a left-wing background so that approach is fitting. You brought up that she is from the left-wing Workers' Party. How is that significant? The protests were mostly organized by the right-wing party that opposes Rousseff...organized by people who didn't vote for her. There aren't people out today protesting. The next demonstrations are scheduled for April 12. I guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that. Yes, well, that's Brazil. It's so the word can get out on social media. If she's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated, will the protests affect her presidency? Rousseff has four years ahead of her, it could end up being very hard for her govern. She won a little over half the vote in October and the people who didn't vote for her are still making their voices heard. And this Petrobras scandal is a problem. Why was the election so close? You have to bring it back to the economy. It had been slowing down, and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like Sao Paulo haven't voted for Rousseff's party, the Workers' Party. The country is at 7.5% inflation. The April 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road, what might happen? The Senate and House speakers are Rousseff's allies and they are among those implicated in the Petrobras scheme. What if she isn't able to get badly needed legislation? What will she do? What will be party do? These questions are hard to answer now.

"Jakarta (CNN)Turkish officials have detained 16 Indonesian citizens who confessed they were planning to cross the border into Syria, Indonesia's foreign ministry said. The group comprises a man, four women, three girls and eight boys, said spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir. The ages of the children have not been released. Nasir told reporters on Friday that the group was stopped in the southeastern Turkish city of Gaziantep, just north of the city of Aleppo in Syria. They admitted to officials they planned to enter Syria, Nasir said. The Indonesian government is sending a security team to Turkey to investigate the group's objectives and plans and to increase cooperation with Turkish security officials, Nasir said. This group of 16 Indonesians is different from another 16 Indonesians who reportedly deserted their tour group recently in Turkey and are feared to have crossed into Syria. Nasir confirmed these are two separate groups.","The group is made up of one man, four women, 11 children .
