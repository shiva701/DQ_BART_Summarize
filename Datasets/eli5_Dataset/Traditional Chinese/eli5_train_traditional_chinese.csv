in football whats the point of wasting the first two plays with a rush - up the middle - not regular rush plays i get those,"Keep the defense honest, get a feel for the pass rush, open up the passing game. An offense that's too one dimensional will fail. And those rushes up the middle can be busted wide open sometimes for big yardage.",在足球中，浪費前兩場比賽的意義是什麼 - 中間 - 不是常規的衝刺，我得到了那些,保持誠實的誠實，讓傳球衝刺，打開傳球比賽。一個維度一維的進攻將失敗。那些沖向中間的匆忙有時會因大碼而被打開。
Why are different tiers (regular < mid < premium) of gas' prices almost always 10 cents different?,"As someone who uses quality Premium, I wish this was true.The difference is in how it burns though is what's critical for you as the end consumer. I drive a forced induction car, so air coming into my engine is compressed before it enters the cylinder where it's further compressed by the piston. The Regular, Mid, and Premium gas are rated by octane, which in the shortest definition is how well it resists ignition, meaning higher octane fuel won't ignite from high pressure or heat, until the spark plug fires. Now that being said, you can look at as a price gouge, as it's not too hard to make higher octane gas, but cars that need it are typically sports cars as their engines run hotter, higher compression, and forced induction. Tying it back into what I said in the beginning, since I drive a forced induction sports car I have to run premium, and gas stations/companies know people like me are going to shut up and pay the extra 30 cents a gallon to protect our engines from lower octane gas detonating in the engine.> Is this just an arbitrary convention that undermines arguments of a rational basis for gasoline prices? You already know the answer.",為什麼不同的層（常規<中<溢價）的天然氣價格幾乎總是不同的10美分？,作為使用質量溢價的人，我希望這是真的。區別在於它的燃燒方式對您作為最終消費者至關重要。我駕駛強制感應車，因此進入我的發動機的空氣在進入氣缸之前被壓縮在其被活塞進一步壓縮的氣缸之前被壓縮。常規，中和高級氣體由辛烷值評估，辛烷值在最短的定義中是它的點火效果，這意味著更高的辛烷值燃料不會因高壓或熱量而點燃，直到火花塞發射為止。話雖這麼說，您可以將價格視為價格哨，因為它不太難以產生更高的辛烷值，但是需要它的汽車通常是跑車，因為它們的發動機運行更熱，更高的壓縮和強迫感應。將其綁在我一開始時說的話，因為我駕駛了一輛強迫感應跑車，所以我必須經營高級，加油站/公司知道像我這樣的人將閉嘴，每加侖額外支付30美分以保護我們發動機中辛烷值下引爆的引擎。>這只是一項任意慣例，破壞了汽油價格理性的論點嗎？您已經知道答案了。
How do we know all the money the government is getting from bank settlements is going back to the people?,I'm pretty confident most of it isn't going back to the people. That's how politics works.,我們怎麼知道政府從銀行和解中賺到的所有錢都回到了人民身上？,我非常有信心，大多數人都不會回到人們身上。這就是政治的工作方式。
What are good and bad sides of manual and automatic drive gear?,"Automatics weigh more, so that alone makes gas mileage worse. They are also more complicated, so that means reliability is going to be lower. It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car. Some people derive satisfaction from shifting, and flexibility in using the power curve.",手動和自動驅動裝備的好方面是什麼？,自動化重量更大，因此僅此一項會使汽油行駛里程更糟。它們也更加複雜，因此這意味著可靠性將降低。它更容易操作，這可能會釋放您的注意力，以關注 *外部 *的汽車。有些人從轉移和使用功率曲線的靈活性中獲得滿意度。
How do muscles grow?,"I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough , but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to ""feed"" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another dayThe enlargement of muscles, known as hypertrophy, is essentially the tearing of muscle fibers being put back together by larger muscle fibers.",肌肉如何生長？,我希望這個答案有資格成為技術的資格，但很簡單，但是我了解的基本思想是，當您鍛煉時，您的肌肉撕裂和撕裂，而您越難推動這些肌肉，它們就越撕裂。因此，這個想法來自更多的代表，而體重更少等於音調，但重量和更少的代表等於更多的肌肉生長。發生的事情是，跟隨那些微小的撕裂和淚水，您的肌肉可以自我癒合，而本質上堆積在本身上，比以前更大，更強壯。使用這些肌肉的越多，保持活躍和挑戰，隨著時間的流逝，它們將繼續建立和成長。其他因素也引入了肌肉的生長，例如您的營養。蛋白質，脂肪等也有一個因素，因為它們會以不同的有效性的方式使您的身體“餵養”您的身體和肌肉 - 但我認為這是ELI5，這是另一天的Eli5肌肉纖維的撕裂被較大的肌肉纖維恢復在一起。
What is the role of actual real-life actors in making animated characters? Like Liam Neeson playing Aslan in Narnia?,"Could you elaborate your question? They are voice actors. They sit in a studio and record their lines. The animators then animate the characters to match the recordings. There are some cases where the voice actors also provides the motions of the character using motion capture technologyFor strictly voice-acting: To draw fans Motion-capture is another story though, such as Andy Serkis in all his roles and Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug.",實際現實生活中演員在製作動畫角色中的作用是什麼？就像利亞姆·尼森（Liam Neeson）在納尼亞（Narnia）扮演阿斯蘭（Aslan）嗎？,您能闡述您的問題嗎？他們是配音演員。他們坐在工作室裡記錄他們的台詞。然後，動畫師為角色動畫以匹配錄音。在某些情況下，配音演員還使用嚴格的語音演員來提供角色的動作：吸引粉絲的動作捕捉是另一個故事，例如安迪·塞爾基斯（Andy Serkis）的所有角色，本尼迪克特·坎伯巴奇（Benedict Cumberbatch）作為Smaug。
Why does the water from my kitchen faucet taste different than the water from my bathroom faucet? Doesn't it come from the same place?,"Yes, but the pipes going to one place could have a build up that's changing the taste or the composition of the pipes can be different, i.e. pvc pipes going to your kitchen, but copper pipes to your bathroom.",為什麼我廚房水龍頭的水味道與我浴室水龍頭的水不同？它不是來自同一個地方嗎？,是的，但是到一個地方的管道可能會有一個堆積的，即改變口味或管道的組成可能會有所不同，即PVC管道去您的廚房，但銅管卻到您的浴室。
"If dark colours absorb more heat, why does light skin burn easier than dark skin?","Two things going on here. First, heat doesn't have anything to do with sunburn, it's all about UV rays. Encountering more UV rays = more sunburn. However, dark skin absorbs more UV rays than pale skin. And in fact that's exactly why it burns less. The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns . Just like sitting outside under an opaque black umbrella would shade you more than sitting outside under a translucent white one.",如果深色吸收更多的熱量，為什麼淺色皮膚比深色皮膚更容易燃燒？,這裡發生了兩件事。首先，熱量與曬傷無關，這全都與紫外線有關。遇到更多的紫外線=更多的曬傷。但是，深色皮膚比淺皮膚吸收更多的紫外線。實際上，這就是為什麼它燃燒少的原因。色素層在皮膚的上層吸收更多的紫外線，從而從紫外線下遮蓋細胞並防止燃燒。就像坐在不透明的黑色雨傘下面一樣，您比坐在半透明的白色下面坐在外面。
How the fuck does Facebook know about people I know?!,"Your email contacts, your academic/work institutions info you've put, and the friends of your friends.Piggyback question : I had a fb acct that only had ~30 people on it. I just used it for work and didn't have any other fb accts. I didn't personally add any address info to that acct, I don't think I provided any info beyond what was required to activate the acct. We had a new apartment manager who called me one day from the leasing office land line and I received 1 email from her that was to an email address not associated with my fb acct. Very shortly after these 2 times she contacted me, she showed up on ""people I may know."" How the hell? I immediately deleted that account, which I didn't really use or want anyway. It creeped me the fuck out because I assumed it was due to some weird permission I granted when agreeing to the terms. I 've always been curious about what happened there. **Edit to add that she wasn't friends with anyone else on my page because she was a brand new apartment manager and this was strictly a work acct.Some speculation and good answers in a thread about this a few months ago. _URL_0_ Think of it this way. It isn't as much about FB knowing who you know, but Facebook already knowing who your friends know. Every data point you give them is another source for them to measure against how you fit into that web.",Facebook如何了解我認識的人？,您的電子郵件聯繫人，您提供的學術/工作機構信息以及您的朋友的朋友。PiggyBack問題：我有一個FB ACCT，其中只有30個人。我只是將其用於工作，沒有其他FB ACCT。我個人沒有在該ACCT中添加任何地址信息，我認為我沒有提供激活ACCT所需的信息。我們有一個新的公寓經理，有一天從租賃辦公室的土地上給我打電話，我收到了她的一封電子郵件，這些電子郵件是與我的FB ACCT無關的電子郵件地址。這兩次與我聯繫後不久，她出現在“我可能認識的人”上。到底如何？我立即刪除了該帳戶，該帳戶我並沒有真正使用或想要。這讓我感到煩惱，因為我認為這是由於我同意該條款時允許的一些奇怪的許可。我一直對那裡發生的事情感到好奇。**編輯以補充說，她不是我頁面上的其他任何人的朋友，因為她是一位全新的公寓經理，這是幾個月前的一個工作中的猜測和一個很好的答案。_url_0_以這種方式考慮。FB知道您認識的人並不是那麼多，但是Facebook已經知道您的朋友認識誰。您給他們的每個數據點是他們與您如何適應該網絡的另一個來源。
Why is chickenpox worse as an adult?,"It's mostly due to the difference in immune system between a child and an adult. A primary varicella zoster infection in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic. Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called ""shingles"" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection.",為什麼水痘成年後會更糟？,這主要是由於兒童和成人之間的免疫系統差異。成年中的主要水素系旋氏菌感染確實與並發症的風險增加有關。這些並發症中的大多數是由於成人免疫系統第一次與病毒接觸的強烈反應。兒童的免疫系統較少，但通常足夠活躍以清除病毒 - 此後使其免疫，因此與這種特殊感染的並發症不太可能。乙型肝炎A：成年人會出現黃疸，而兒童無症狀。注意：成年期間的繼發性水痘帶狀皰疹感染稱為“帶狀皰疹”，由於第二種感染時已經存在的免疫力，在成年期間的危險通常不如原發性水痘。
How do movies not get uploaded online in HD from movie theater employees before their DVD release?,"The theater will be fined a massive amount of money for allowing a leak, the person leaking it will be fined a massive amount of money for uploading it, and they automatically lose their job. This is a combination of copyright law violation and contracts that you sign when taking the job. So the risk are so extremely high that most will not risk it. They also have security features such as login codes to open, proprietary file types that need special programs to play, and the rooms operating the projector system requiring special key access at times.The movies are shipped to the theaters in special hard drive enclosures that are tamper-proof and force every access to be logged. The film itself is encrypted in a way that's tied to specific projectors. It's not like you can just copy a file over - they've thought this shit through thoroughly and any theater that tries to break the security will get sued to hell and back **and** never get another movie again.",電影劇院員工在DVD發行之前，如何在電影劇院員工的高清上上傳電影？,劇院將被罰款大量的錢來洩露洩漏，洩漏的人將被罰款大量的錢來上傳，並自動丟掉工作。這是您在工作時簽署的版權法和合同的結合。因此，風險是如此之高，以至於大多數人不會冒險。他們還具有安全功能，例如要打開的登錄代碼，需要特殊程序的專有文件類型，以及操作投影儀系統需要特殊關鍵訪問的房間。防篡改並強制登錄的所有訪問。這部電影本身以與特定投影儀相關的方式進行加密。這並不是您只能複制一個文件 - 他們已經徹底地認為這是狗屎，任何試圖打破安全性的劇院都會被起訴到地獄，然後**和**再也不會再拍另一部電影。
Can defense attorneys 'throw' a case if they know their clients are guilty?,"Yes, they could 'throw\' a case. However, that's a serious ethics violation which would almost certainly cause disbarment if found out, and not only that, the conviction could then be appealed based on ineffective assistance of counsel . If it makes it easier to wrap your head around, think of defense lawyers defending the integrity of the judicial system, not just their client. The idea being, the system must obey all of its own rules in proving that someone is guilty, or else it's a dishonest system and could easily ""prove"" that an innocent person is guilty next time. Defense lawyers are there to help ensure the system stays honestThat would be unethical. In our society, even the guilty are given competent representation. What they can do is seriously suggest that the person take a plea deal. Part of the process requires a good defense or the conviction can be overturned on appeal.",如果辯護律師知道自己的客戶有罪，他們可以“拋棄”案件嗎？,是的，他們可以“扔”一個案子。但是，這是一種嚴重的違反道德規範，幾乎可以肯定會導致解散，不僅如此，因此可以根據律師的無效協助對定罪進行上訴。如果它使您的頭更容易，請考慮辯護律師捍衛司法系統的完整性，而不僅僅是他們的客戶。這個想法是，該系統必須遵守自己的所有規則，以證明某人有罪，否則它是一種不誠實的系統，並且可以輕鬆地“證明”無辜的人下次有罪。辯護律師在那裡有助於確保該系統保持誠實，這是不道德的。在我們的社會中，即使是有罪的人也有能力的代表。他們能做的就是認真暗示該人達成認罪協議。該過程的一部分需要良好的辯護，或者可以在上訴中推翻定罪。
"why, when intoxicated, does it feel like everything is spinning when you close your eyes but stops spinning when you open them?","the fluid in your inner ear keeps you orientated and standing upwards, although when your drunk certain functions in your brain don't work as well or as they are meant to. So if you've had a bit too much to drink, your brain might not be able to tell which way is up and which way is down if your inner ears are miscommunicating with your brain. So that's why when you close your eyes it feels like you're falling off the face of the world.",為什麼，當醉酒時，當您閉上眼睛時，都會感覺到一切都在旋轉，但是當您張開它們時停止旋轉？,內耳中的液體使您保持定向並站立，儘管當您喝醉的大腦中的某些功能無法正常工作或原本可以正常工作時。因此，如果您有太多的喝酒，那麼您的大腦可能無法分辨出哪種方式向上，如果您的內耳與大腦溝通不暢，那麼哪種方式會下降。因此，這就是為什麼當您閉上眼睛時，感覺就像您在世界上脫落了。
"Why are some fish bones edible, and others are not?","They are small and soft so it does not matter if you swallow them, bigger and harder bones might get stuck in your throat and couse pain",為什麼有些魚骨可食用，而另一些則沒有？,它們小而柔軟，因此吞嚥它們，更大更堅硬的骨頭可能會卡在您的喉嚨並疼痛，這無關緊要
"What's the meaning of the phrase ""I've got a bone to pick with you.""","If you have a bone to pick with someone, it means they 've annoyed or insulted you and you need to talk to them about it.

Depending on the tone of the conversation it might indicate somebody is really really mad at you about something, or just that they have a minor problem they want to talk about, so context is important.",“我有一個骨頭要和你一起挑選的話”是什麼意思。,如果您與某人有骨頭，那意味著他們對您感到煩惱或侮辱您，您需要與他們談論。根據牛津英語詞典的說法，“挑選的骨頭”最初意味著佔據或分散您的注意力，並以某種方式變成了它的現代意義，類似於“我對您不滿意並想討論它”。根據對話的語氣，它可能表明某人真的對您真的很生氣，或者只是他們想談論的是一個小問題，因此上下文很重要。
Why can't we just taste candy or Sweets and then spit it out to avoid its unhealthy attributes? What makes us swallow it to get satisfaction?,"You absolutely could. But the fact is that evolution shaped our tastes. That's why fatty foods and sweet foods are so appealing to out taste buds. It is our bodies way of saying ""That has lots of calories and will help us avoid starving."" The 'satisfaction\' you feel on swallowing it is simply the body saying ""Good job. Remember that tastes good so we will eat it again if we find it again."" Rewarding you for fueling it. You can see why this system that evolved when we were hunter gatherers to keep us from starving and helping us learn whats best to eat leads to obesity now that we have food options everywhere anytime we want. Fun fact: Most people mistake the bodies thirst craving for being hungry. More often than not if you drink a glass of water when you feel the urge to snack it will go away. Thus helping you lose weight by reducing total calorie intake.",為什麼我們不能只是品嚐糖果或甜食，然後將其吐出來避免其不健康的屬性？是什麼讓我們吞下它以使其滿意？,你絕對可以。但事實是，進化塑造了我們的口味。這就是為什麼脂肪食品和甜食如此吸引人的味蕾。這是我們的身體說：“有很多卡路里，可以幫助我們避免挨餓。”您對吞嚥的“滿意度”只是說“好工作。請記住，味道很好，所以如果我們再次找到它，我們會再次食用。”獎勵您加油。您會明白為什麼當我們成為獵人收集者時，這種系統會不斷發展，以防止我們挨餓，並幫助我們學習最好的食用，因為我們隨時隨地都有食物選擇。有趣的事實：大多數人誤認為屍體渴望飢餓。通常，如果您感覺到零食的衝動會消失時，通常會喝一杯水。因此，通過減少總卡路里攝入量來幫助您減輕體重。
Why are the things that taste the best bad for us?,"Let's think about this from an evolutionary perspective. Way back in the day, humans struggled for food just like every other animal. It was to our species evolutionary advantage to pursue food that would keep us full longer, or provide more energy than other food options. Fats, are 9 calories per gram compared to proteins and carbs that are 4 calories. Humans that preferred fats and craved them, had a higher chance of survival and passing on the fat craving trait. Fast forward to present day where food is plentiful. We are still programmed to eat high calorie foods just in case we won't find food for a week!",為什麼味道最好的東西對我們有害？,讓我們從進化的角度考慮一下。回到過去，人類像其他動物一樣掙扎著為食物而苦苦掙扎。追求食物可以使我們飽滿或提供比其他食物選擇更多的能量，這是我們物種進化的優勢。與4卡路里的蛋白質和碳水化合物相比，脂肪為每克9卡路里。偏愛脂肪並渴望它們的人，生存的機會更高，並傳遞了渴望的特徵。快進到當今食物豐富的地方。我們仍然被編程為吃高卡路里的食物，以防萬一我們一周找不到食物！

What classifies an island as an island? Aren't all continents etc essentially large islands?,"While not universally true A continent is considered to be the primary landmass on its tectonic plate. If you look at a map of tectonic plates: _URL_0_ You can clearly see that with a few notable exceptions such as Europe and India. In general continents occupy their own tectonic plate. So then if you are a landmass that is part of a continent's tectonic plate but is not connected by land to that continent, than you would be an island.

why does wikipedia ask for donations almost every month? do they really need it to not disappear?,"Wikipedia's biggest issue is that their amazing service requires constant overhead. So donations keep it running. Have you ever been inside a server location. That shit is cold, and cold is expensive.Like PBS, it relies on donations for operations. No donations = no money to pay for operations. Even if you manage to get $1mil in your coffers, does that mean you can stop asking for donations? No. Servers and IT support still costs thousands per month. Staff personnel still costs tens of thousands a monthYes, servers and network connections cost a lot of money and Wikipedia is not funded by ads. Part of the price you pay when you use a common service is paying for it. You can not give money, and then everything is Facebook - funded by people who want to control your opinions.",為什麼維基百科幾乎每個月都要求捐款？他們真的需要它不要消失嗎？,維基百科最大的問題是他們的驚人服務需要不斷的開銷。因此，捐款使它保持運轉。您是否曾經進入服務器位置。那狗屎很冷，寒冷很昂貴。沒有捐款=沒有錢支付運營。即使您設法在金庫中獲得100萬美元，這是否意味著您可以停止要求捐款？否。服務器和它的支持仍然每月成千上萬。員工人員仍需花費數万個月，服務器和網絡連接花費大量金錢，而Wikipedia並未由廣告資助。使用普通服務時，您支付的一部分是為此付費。您不能捐錢，然後一切都是Facebook  - 由想要控制您的意見的人資助。

"Why is the recent Apple vs. FBI encryption debate relevant years after the Snowden leaks (2013), passage of the PATRIOT Act (2001), and the ECHELON revelations (1988)?","The Apple debate has nothing to do with the government's right to get the information. They had a warrant from a judge, who has way more certainty than probable cause to believe that the phone was used by someone who committed a crime. They also had permission from the owner of the phone to access it. It's about as clear as it can be that the government has a right to that phone. What's also clear is that if Apple had a way to get into the phone, they would have to provide that to the FBI. Since Apple didn't have a way to get in, they didn't have anything to give to the FBI. They also did not want to make a tool to bypass their own security measures . The FBI wanted to force them to make such a thing. And whether or not the FBI could force that was being debated. The most relevant law concerning this- the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act says that the FBI can't force Apple to do this. So the FBI tried to interpret a very old law, passed by the first Congress, as ""we can force anyone to do anything as long as we get a judge to sign off on it"".

Why does a beer on tap almost always taste better than it does from a bottle?,"Probably because the keg has been better handled than the cases of beer have, and because bottles are not actually the best packages for beer. Light passes through the glass and can cause skunking, and oxygen can sneak in through the plastic seal in the crown, causing staling. Kegs are generally stored cold, and of course are completely opaque and are much more resistant to oxygen ingressBottled beer is generally pasteurized while draught beer from a keg has not. The heat can change the flavor slightly. Also, since most of taste is smell, drinking from an open glass rather than a bottle gives you a bigger experience of the flavor.",為什麼水龍頭的啤酒幾乎總是比瓶子的味道更好？,可能是因為小桶的處理要比啤酒的案例更好，而且瓶子實際上並不是啤酒的最佳包裝。光穿過玻璃並可能引起臭鼬，氧氣可以通過牙冠中的塑料密封潛入，從而導致僵硬。小桶通常被冷藏，當然是完全不透明的，並且對氧氣的啤酒具有更大的耐藥性，而桶中的啤酒卻沒有。熱量會稍微改變風味。另外，由於大部分味道是氣味，因此從開放式玻璃而不是瓶子喝酒可以為您提供更大的風味體驗。

How do devices know the amount of charge left in a battery?,"I think the best way to explain this is through an analogy. Imagine you have two tanks of water. One has a lot of water and the other is empty. If you were to connect a pipe running from the bottom of one tank to the bottom of the other, water would flow through the pipe until both tanks have the same level of water. If you were to put a water wheel in the path of the water flowing through the pipe, you could use the flow of the water to do work. Batteries work the same way. They create a ""potential difference"" between the terminals. This is a fancy way of saying one terminal has a lot more electrons than the other, just like the tank with more water. If you were to connect the terminals with a ""pipe"" that would allow electrons to flow to the terminal with little electrons, they would. We can also use that flow of electrons to do work for us as they go from one terminal to another, such as power a screen. We can estimate how much energy is left in a battery the same way we can estimate how much more water is left in the full tank. As the amount of water-difference between the tanks decreases, so will the speed at which the water flows through the pipe and consequently the speed at which the water wheel spins. Similarly, as the amount of potential-difference between the terminals of a battery decreases, so does the current of electrons and consequently, the amount of work that current can do. Devices can measure that decrease in work and use that to estimate the amount of potential difference left in the battery', ""The Voltage of a battery depends on the charge. A five voltage battery may start with 5.1 Volt and slowly go down. When you're at 4.9 volt you'll know the battery is rather empty. I'm not sure if that is the case for all modern Rechargeable batteries. They might have special measuring and charging chips included.",設備如何知道電池中剩下的充電量？,我認為最好的方法是通過類比。想像一下，您有兩個水。一個有很多水，另一個是空的。如果要連接從一個水箱底部運行的管道到另一個水箱的底部，水將流過管道，直到兩個水箱都具有相同水平的水。如果要將水輪放在流過管道的水路徑中，則可以使用水流進行工作。電池以相同的方式工作。它們在終端之間創建了“電勢差”。這是一種奇特的方式，即一個終端具有比另一個終端的電子要多得多，就像儲罐有更多的水一樣。如果要將端子與“管道”連接起來，該端子可以使電子用小電子流到端子，它們會。我們還可以利用電子流從一個端子到另一個終端（例如屏幕上的電源）來為我們工作。我們可以估計電池中剩下多少能量，就像估計全油箱中還剩多少水。隨著儲罐之間的水分差異降低，水通過管道的速度以及水輪旋轉的速度也會降低。同樣，隨著電池端子之間的潛在差異量減少，電子電流也減少了，因此電流可以做到的工作量。設備可以衡量工作減少並使用它來估計電池中剩下的電位差的量”，“電池的電壓取決於充電。五電壓電池可能以5.1伏的速度開始，然後慢慢下降。“在4.9伏特時，您會知道電池相當空。我不確定所有現代可充電電池是否都是這種情況。它們可能具有特殊的測量和充電芯片。
Why are my muscles sore after jumping in cold water?,"From what I understand, our bodies defenses against hypothermia is to shiver. This involves involuntary muscle contractions to generate heat. These muscles contractions still can cause muscle soreness just like working out.Many athletes actually use a cold bath post workout to *alleviate* soreness. The idea is that the cold constricts blood vessels and reduces swelling, then afterwards the blood can flow back and speed recovery. This is especially popular amongst competitive cyclists. If your muscles are sore after cold exposure, maybe they're just stiff and lacking blood flow. I've noticed it's hard to pedal after a dip in a cool lake midway through a ride. As the muscles rewarm, they regain their mobility.You probably just contract all your muscles as you hit the water, same as being hit by a car and feeling sore. Source: am hit by car once",為什麼我的肌肉跳入冷水後會酸痛？,據我了解，我們的身體防禦體溫是顫抖。這涉及非自願肌肉收縮以產生熱量。這些肌肉收縮仍然會像鍛煉一樣引起肌肉酸痛。許多運動員實際上使用冷浴後的鍛煉來 *減輕 *酸痛。這個想法是，寒冷會收縮血管並減少腫脹，然後血液會流動並加速恢復。這在競爭騎自行車的人中尤其受歡迎。如果您的肌肉在冷暴露後會酸痛，也許它們只是僵硬而缺乏血液流動。我注意到在乘車中途浸入涼爽的湖泊中，很難踩踏。隨著肌肉的恢復，它們會恢復流動性。當您撞到水中時，您可能只是收縮所有的肌肉，就像被汽車撞到並感到酸痛一樣。資料來源：一次被汽車撞到
why do we like watching the same TV show or movie over and over again?,"Our brains like familiar things. Something we already have seen is easier to get into than something brand new because it requires less attention and effort from our brain.

- Why do phones not require cooling vents but other small appliances do?,"Phones lack a cooling system because there's no room for that. It takes up way too much space for a pocket-size device. If that wasn't an issue, phones would've had vents. Besides, phones don't work as hard as other computers do. They are weaker, so they produce less heat. Still, they can get hot sometimes, especially during charging, and there is nothing we can do about it. Phones cool by radiating heat away and through conduction - passing heat into the surrounding air/skin.Phones are very specifically engineered to be both low heat and to have passive cooling systems to dissipate that heat. It take a lot of engineering to do this properly, but it is necessary for a device that is meant to be carried and hand held. Other appliances _could_ have systems like this, but there is no real need for them. They can be large enough to have larger and more active cooling systems, which are less difficult to engineer and less costly to implement. Since there is no real benefit to making these other appliances smaller, they use the easier/cheaper cooling techHow much additional cooling a given component needs depends on how much heat it releases during use, on what temperature it can tolerate internally before it gets damaged, and on what equilibrium temperature the surrounding environment reaches during use. In a phone, if a part is getting too hot, you only really have a couple options: modify the design or operating conditions so it makes less heat Improve thermal conductivity between the part and the outside of the phone. Phones are typically underclocked to reduce power consumption and heat generation. And they start with low power parts to begin with. Heat is removed just by letting it passively radiate from the phone.", - 為什麼手機不需要冷卻通風口，而是其他小型電器？,電話缺乏冷卻系統，因為沒有餘地。對於袖珍設備，它佔用太多空間。如果這不是問題，手機將有通風。此外，手機的工作不如其他計算機那樣努力。它們較弱，因此產生的熱量較少。儘管如此，有時它們會變熱，尤其是在充電期間，我們對此無能為力。手機通過散發熱量並通過傳導來冷卻 - 將熱量傳遞到周圍的空氣/皮膚中。手機非常專門設計為低熱量，並且具有被動冷卻系統以消散熱量。正確執行此操作需要大量的工程，但是對於要攜帶和握住的設備是必要的。其他電器_could_具有這樣的系統，但是對它們沒有真正的需求。它們可能足夠大，可以擁有更大，更活躍的冷卻系統，這些冷卻系統不太難理，實施成本較低。由於使這些其他設備較小沒有真正的好處，因此它們使用更輕鬆/更便宜的冷卻技術，而給定的組件需求的其他額外冷卻取決於它在使用過程中發出的熱量，並且在損壞，損壞，損壞，在內部可以耐受的溫度可以忍受。以及在使用過程中周圍環境達到的平衡溫度。在手機中，如果零件變得太熱，您確實只有幾個選擇：修改設計或操作條件，從而使熱量更少改善手機零件和外部之間的熱導率。手機通常會發出底線，以減少功耗和發熱。它們從低功率零件開始。僅通過使其從手機被動輻射來消除熱量。

"If you put tires on your car that are larger than the ones from the factory, would you actually be going slower than the reading on your speedometer?","No, you'll actually be going faster. The speed is calculated based on the OEM tire size, whereas if you put a larger tire on, there is more circumference so the hub will spin slower, yet will be traveling the same speed. You can have it recalibrated fairly cheaply.Example: Your car comes with factory-installed tires that are 21.8 inches in diameter. That means the circumference of each tire is 68.5 inches. Now let’s say you want to replace the stock tires with new tires that are 24.6 inches in diameter. Each new tire has a circumference of 77.3 inches, which means it travels almost 10 inches farther with each complete revolution. This has a tremendous affect on your speedometer, which will now indicate a speed that is too slow by almost 13 percent. When your speedometer reads 60 miles per hour, your car will actually be traveling 67.7 miles per hour!

What is slowing down our internet speeds?,"ISP backbones tend to oversell their bandwidth, because not everyone is using their maximum allocation all the time, so there would be unused potential that isn't generating profits. This is how your neighbors can slow you down. Much of your connection is just you and your wire until you get to some shared trunk. Second, cheap home equipment can be a significant slowdown; I 'd say even the equipment you're renting from your ISP can be crap that can't deliver. Buying something good will require research beyond the scope of this post. Third, there are slow downs caused by the routing protocols as well as a fundamental design flaw in our network infrastructure. I mean, it takes time to process a packet at each hop, but this shouldn't be terribly significant. But the fundamental flaw is buffer bloat. Look it up, it was identified just a couple years ago. Basically, our routing protocols control data rates and latency by responding to dropped packets; if you're sending more than the receiving end can handle, you slow down. Well, routing equipment these days have a lot of ram, so if they can't send as fast as they're receiving your data, they're just going to buffer your data packets at full speed until the buffer maxes out, then they drop packets. You respond by slowing down, the buffer clears out just a bit, and you start sending at full speed again, until the buffer maxes out. It's dip, after dip, after dip, after dip And this KILLS performance. The current best way to fix it is to reduce the RAM in the equipment, but no manufacturer is going to sell their newest HyperFast Router, ""Now with LESS RAM!!!"" Our routing protocols were designed this way because the early internet didn't have massive buffers, hardware was expensive and so it was out of necessity. We now need new protocols that can take this buffering into account, and they're working on it.",是什麼速度降低了我們的互聯網速度？,ISP骨架傾向於超出其帶寬，因為並非每個人都一直在使用最大分配，因此將有未使用的潛力不會產生利潤。這就是您的鄰居可以減慢您的速度。您的大部分連接都是您和電線，直到您到達一些共享的後備箱為止。其次，廉價的家庭設備可能會大大放緩。我說，即使您從ISP租用的設備也可能是無法交付的廢話。購買好東西將需要研究本文範圍之外的研究。第三，由路由協議以及我們的網絡基礎架構中的基本設計缺陷引起的降低。我的意思是，在每個跳躍上處理一個數據包需要時間，但這並不重要。但是基本缺陷是緩衝膨脹。查找，幾年前就被確定了。基本上，我們的路由協議通過響應掉落的數據包來控制數據速率和延遲；如果您的發送超過接收端可以處理的更多，那麼您會放慢腳步。好吧，如今的路由設備有很多RAM，因此，如果它們無法像收到數據一樣快地發送，那麼他們將全速緩衝您的數據包，直到緩衝區最大化，然後他們滴小包。您通過放慢速度來做出響應，緩衝區僅清除一點，然後再次以全速發送，直到緩衝區最大化。浸入後，浸入後，它是浸入後的蘸醬，這會殺死性能。目前的解決方法的最佳方法是減少設備中的RAM，但沒有製造商將出售其最新的HyperFast路由器，“現在使用RAM減少！！！”我們的路由協議之所以設計，是因為早期互聯網沒有大量的緩衝區，硬件很昂貴，因此不必要。現在，我們需要可以考慮使用此緩衝的新協議，並且正在努力。

Why are the insides of Ovens Dark and Not Metallic or Mirror Like?,"How often do you polish the inside of your oven? I suspect a big reason would be just to keep the interior from quickly looking horribleThe inside walls of an oven are at the same temperature as the interior of the oven . So any heat they do absorb is just going to be re-emitted back into the oven, even if they are not shiny. Much of the heat to the interior actually comes from the inside walls in the first place. Most ovens have the heating element heat the floor of the oven . The floor conducts that heat to the walls, and then the floor and walls radiate that heat into the interior cavity. If the walls where shiny, they would not radiate as well. That is one of the symmetries in physics. If you reflect a wavelength when it hits your surface rather than absorbing it, then you also ""internally reflect"" that wavelength rather than emitting it.

Why does metal react so violently when microwaved?,"The way microwaves work is through jiggling charged/polar particles in your food . This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another. Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike.",微波爐時為什麼金屬反應如此劇烈？,微波處理的方式是通過在食物中搖動充電/極性顆粒。這種搖擺不定，增加了溫度，並加熱了您的其餘食物。這就是為什麼您不能盡可能輕鬆地給油加熱。但是，像鐵這樣的金屬是電子的 *大導體。使它們良好的導體有些複雜的原因，但基本上，原因是它們的電子湯從原子轉移到原子，將電子從一個原子移到另一個原子所需的近0能量。因此，當微波爐搖晃這些電子，而不是給原子賦予能量時，它將其提供給湯中四處滑動的電子。給湯的能量量可能會變得足夠高，以繞過空氣的自然絕緣層，並導致電子從金屬跳躍並通過空氣撕裂。這稱為火花，基本上是在雷擊中發生的事情。

The key thing relevant to your question though is that accents change a lot, that distance and separation make this process easier and more likely, and that neither English nor an American speakers sound much like their 16th century forebears.",美國口音是如何產生的？,美國人並沒有產生獨特的口音，而是大西洋兩邊的講話發生了很大變化，雙方都與他們早些時候聽起來的聲音有很大不同。這一過程仍在發生，在這一刻和相反的方向上，加拿大和我們的大湖的口音在元音中發生了變化。加拿大和美國的口音實際上變得越來越不相似，即使在尼亞加拉地區相距幾公里的人們中也是如此。為什麼？我們根本不太了解這個過程。與您的問題相關的關鍵是，口音發生了很大變化，距離和分離使這個過程變得更容易，更有可能，而且英語和美國人的說話者聽起來都不像他們16世紀的前輩。
Why is it when you rewind VHS tapes they lose their quality over time?,"Since rewinding needs to be done for each playback, what makes you think it is the rewinding which causes quality loss? Tapes lose quality over time whether you play them or not due to breakdown of the binder and dry lubricant. Rewinding is no more damaging than playback if the VCR is functioning correctly. There is a phenomenon called [print-through] which transfers signal from one layer to the next. Professional audio engineers often store reel to reel tapes ""tails out"". That means without rewinding. It doesn't stop print-through, but it does make it happen later rather than earlier, so on playback it will be heard after a track rather than before. Source: 40 years experience in broadcast VTR/VCR maintenanceVHS tapes are a magnetic tape wrapped over two spindles. Your VCR scans the tape as it goes from one spindle to the other, and you see the information. Moving the tape back and forth between the spindles and through the read/record head stresses the tape, and damages it over time. Damage on the tape results in lower quality picture and soundTapes store the video or audio information on a magnetic ""tape"", and basically what happens is, as it gets used over several years, the magnetic tape loses its magnetism a little bit, so you get ""lowered quality"" in the data.",為什麼當您倒帶VHS磁帶時，它們會隨著時間的流逝而失去質量？,由於需要為每個播放進行倒帶，因此您認為是造成質量損失的是倒帶呢？無論您是否播放粘合劑和乾燥潤滑劑的崩潰，磁帶會隨著時間的流逝而失去質量。如果VCR正常運行，返回並沒有比播放更具破壞性。有一個稱為[print-through]的現象，它將信號從一層傳輸到另一層。專業的音頻工程師經常將捲軸存儲在“尾聲”上。這意味著不回顧。它不會停止打印，但確實會使它發生在以後而不是更早的情況下，因此在播放時，它將在軌道後而不是以前聽到。資料來源：廣播VTR/VCR維護VHS磁帶的40年經驗是包裹在兩個主軸上的磁帶。您的VCR從一個主軸轉到另一個主軸時會掃描磁帶，您會看到信息。在紡錘體之間並通過讀取/記錄的頭部來回移動膠帶會壓力膠帶，並隨著時間的推移而損壞它。磁帶的損壞導致質量較低的圖片和音圖存儲在磁性“磁帶”上的視頻或音頻信息，基本上發生的是，隨著幾年來使用，磁帶會稍微失去磁性，所以您在數據中獲得“降低質量”。

Now, if you were able to draw the way your eardrum vibrates back and forth like a earthquake seismograph, now you have a line that makes the shape of the whole orchestra! Now just make a groove in that same exact shape, hook it up to a microphone, and now you have those sounds again, just like the instruments were there.",記錄/LP上的凹槽如何實際重現完整樂團的聲音？,想想每種儀器都會產生振動 - 有些響亮，有些柔軟，有些吹牛，有些光滑，有些在一個音高，另一些則在另一個音高。這些振動中的每一個加在一起，並在美麗的混亂中反彈。由於您的大腦能夠一次處理所有這些聲音，因此耳膜振動的特定方式振動！現在，如果您能夠像地震地震儀那樣繪製耳服來回振動的方式，那麼現在您有了一條使整個樂團形狀的線！現在，只要以相同的形狀進行凹槽，將其連接到麥克風上，現在您會再次有這些聲音，就像樂器在那裡一樣。
"In the English language, how are contractions prioritized when a word can belong to two different contractions?","It's a matter of emphasis. ""We aren't going"" could be simply spoken, or the ""we"" could be emphasized . Similarly ""We're not going"" could be used to emphasize the ""not"" part. Beyond that it's preference. The stylistic choices of language are everywhere, and it's one of the main reasons that most sentences of reasonable length have never been written beforeSome phrasings are more regional/taught through environment as opposed to what would be most appropriate. Sometimes the different contractions can indicate a mood or assertiveness, but it's not absolute. ""We're not going"" sounds resolute, has some finality to it. ""We aren't going"" sounds more casual, to me. ""We are not going"" sounds like somebody trying to convince me or guilt trip somebody. Assuming it's not a conscious decision, I'm gonna go with it just being habit.",在英語中，當一個單詞屬於兩個不同的收縮時，如何優先考慮收縮？,這是一個重點。可以簡單地說“我們不會去”，也可以強調“我們”。同樣，“我們不去”也可以用來強調“不是”部分。除此之外，這是偏好。語言的風格選擇無處不在，這是大多數合理長度句子從未寫過的句子的主要原因之一是通過環境而不是最合適的環境來進行區域/教導。有時，不同的收縮會表明心情或自信，但這不是絕對的。“我們不會去”聽起來有些堅決，對此有一定的終結性。對我來說，“我們不會去”聽起來更隨意。“我們不會去”聽起來像是有人試圖說服我或有罪的旅行。假設這不是一個有意識的決定，我將繼續習慣。
Eating things from other planets or moons.,"There is a big piece to this question which is not intuitive: chirality. Basically, the food we eat is useful to our bodies because the molecules can be used to build or repair our cells or can be turned into energy. Either way, our cells make use of chemicals called enzymes that are basically molecule sized tools. Enzymes literally fit around the molecules they are designed to attach to, so the shape is very important. Ok, you go to Europa , and find a fish that looks particularly tasty. On inspection, it seems like it is made of similar stuff to life on earth: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. You eat the fish for a while And starve to death. Turns out that because the fish evolved on a different planet, it's molecules, while similar to ours, are like mirror images of ours. They don't fit into our enzymes, and so our bodies can't digest them. Chirality appears on earth, too. The chemical that makes spearmint taste minty is a mirror image of the flavor of caraway seeds . Interestingly, all life on earth shares the same chirality, evidence of a common tree of life.",吃其他行星或月亮的東西。,這個問題有一個很大的問題，它不是直觀的：手性。基本上，我們吃的食物對我們的身體很有用，因為分子可用於構建或修復我們的細胞，也可以變成能量。無論哪種方式，我們的細胞都使用稱為酶的化學物質，這些化學物質基本上是分子大小的工具。酶從字面上貼合其設計為附著的分子，因此形狀非常重要。好吧，您去歐羅巴，找到看起來特別好吃的魚。在檢查時，似乎它是與地球上生命相似的東西製成的：碳，氫，氧氣等。您吃了一段時間，然後餓死了。事實證明，由於魚在另一個星球上演變而來，它是分子，雖然與我們的分子相似，就像我們的鏡像一樣。它們不適合我們的酶，因此我們的身體無法消化它們。手性也出現在地球上。使長矛味薄荷的化學物質是香菜種子風味的鏡像。有趣的是，地球上的所有生命都具有相同的手性，這是一種共同的生命樹的證據。

How do you build a Nanorobot..?,"Weeeeellllllllllll the title \'nanorobot\' is a bit misleading in this case, they actually genetically engineered some salmonella bacteria to seek out cancer cells. They also filled the bacteria with cancer killing drugs and programmed it to explode on contact with a cancerous cell, providing targeted medication which means they can use more powerful drugs without causing the collateral damage normally associated with eg. chemotherapy . While this is very cool and definitely the way forward for medicine, it falls more under the category of Genetic Modification than Nanorobotics. These do have a lot of overlap as a lot of nanorobot production is done using genetically modified cells because.. cells are good at that kind of thing, however there are a load of stigma and negative connotations attached to GM stuff, so most medical development uses Nanorobotics as a descriptor because it makes it more likely to receive positive press coverage and funding. And use, patient confidence is important, which sounds better ""we would like to fill you full of genetically engineered super-bacteria-suicide-bombers blow up your cancer"" or ""we would like to introduce an army of nanorobots to annihilate the cancerous cells"".

Why doesn't it rain salt water?,"When water evaporates, it gets heated to an extent that the water particles move faster and spread apart, which causes them to become ""lighter"" than the air around them, turning into water vapor, a gas. Due to this, they rise up into the atmosphere. Then, they start to cool down, and become liquid again. When they become cool enough that they're heavier than the air, it rains back down. This is the basic water cycle. The salt which makes it salt water requires a much higher temperature to turn into gas, one which doesn't normally happen during this cycle. Because of this, it does not follow the water, and thus, it doesn't rain salt waterThe rise in temperature that is required to evaporate the water is less than that is needed to evaporate salt water, as a result, the water is evaporated and the salt gets left behind. You can see this sometimes if you wear a black hat on a hot sunny day.

Why drill instructor in the army never stop screaming at recruit in the army?,"> What's the point of screaming at people like that? It is intended to rattle the recruits mentally, making them feel like they are incapable and useless. The idea is to break their self-esteem and then the group will be given tasks where the support of the entire unit is necessary to succeed. To drive the point home they will often employ collective punishment so every recruit has an interest in making sure their peers succeed. All this has the goal of making the resulting soldiers psychologically dependent upon the military and their comrades. By creating this bond through surviving abuse it puts the soldiers in a better position to be confident in the support of their peers during combat, and for those peers to run into danger in the support of their comrades. Such a technique makes great soldiers.

"Why do books downloaded from the library need to be ""returned"" after a given amount of time?","> This makes no sense because downloads are not limited like physical copies of books are. Downloads are limited in the sense that the library has to pay for every copy of a book that they own, including digital copies. So they pay the publisher $X for permission to lend some fixed number of digital copies. And the reader software is set up to that the borrower isn't able to retain possess of that copy forever. If that weren't the case, then book sales would drop essentially to nothing, since everyone could just get a free copy of any book whenever they wanted for as long as they wanted.Publishers want them to be limited though. Otherwise, people could just borrow as many books as they wanted and it 'd be no different than buying them. They work out licenses with library on how many digital copies can be ""loaned"" out at a time. I'm not sure if it's the library or the publisher that sets limits on how long they can be borrowed though.",為什麼從圖書館下載的書籍需要在給定時間後“返回”？,>這是沒有意義的，因為下載不像書籍的實物副本一樣受到限制。下載是有限的，因為圖書館必須為其擁有的每本書（包括數字副本）付費。因此，他們向出版商支付了$ X的許可，以藉出一些固定數量的數字副本。並且讀者軟件設置為藉款人無法永遠保留該副本的擁有。如果事實並非如此，那麼書籍銷售本質上就會下降，因為每個人都可以隨時隨地免費獲得任何書籍的免費副本。否則，人們只能藉盡可能多的書，這與購買它們沒有什麼不同。他們通過圖書館獲得許可證，一次可以“借給”多少個數字副本。我不確定是圖書館還是發布者設置了可以藉用多長時間的限制。

why does spicy food make me sweat?,"""The answer hinges on the fact that spicy foods excite the receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat. Those receptors are pain fibers, technically known as polymodal nociceptors. They respond to temperature extremes and to intense mechanical stimulation, such as pinching and cutting; they also respond to certain chemical influences.

"How can a computer come up with a ""random"" number?","Generally yes, anything generated by an algorithm can be reproduced if you know the ""initial"" settings. Numbers generated this way are referred to as ""psuedorandom"". There do, however, exist various dedicated hardware solutions that allow computers to pick truly random numbers. They work by basically installing in the computer some sort of sensor that can detect random properties of nature. An example might be some sort of detector that picks up low levels of radiation. While we can make statistical predictions of radioactive decay over time, the actual decay of individual particles is truly random, and cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. A sensor designed to measure those tiny random variations and feed them to a computer could generate truly random numbers.",計算機如何提出“隨機”號碼？,通常，如果您知道“初始”設置，則可以復制算法生成的任何內容。以這種方式生成的數字稱為“ psuedorandom”。但是，確實存在各種專用硬件解決方案，使計算機可以選擇真正的隨機數。它們基本上通過在計算機中安裝某種可以檢測自然隨機屬性的傳感器來起作用。一個示例可能是某種探測器，可以吸收較低的輻射水平。雖然我們可以隨著時間的流逝做出放射性衰減的統計預測，但單個顆粒的實際衰減確實是隨機的，不能完全準確地預測。一種旨在測量那些微小隨機變化並將其饋送到計算機的傳感器可以產生真正的隨機數。
Why are scars near impossible to get rid of?,"Scar tissue is different to normal skin. It contains more collagen than regular tissue, and doesn't structure the same as regular skin, which is why it looks so different. It's also less flexible. The benefits to having scar tissue is the body can recover from wounds exceptionally quickly - many animals can't create scar tissue, and so wounds can remain open longer and are more susceptible to infection and other problems. Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen , your scars' wounds can actually reopen. The scar is difficult to get rid of because the tissue has been created in a less structured/ordered form than your regular skin , but some medical procedures exist to reduce that effect.Scars are a normal and natural part of the healing process. When the body heals, collagen protein which is found in normal and healthy tissue in a randomish pattern, forms in a more organized way. This allows for healing but because it is different than the normal skin - it stands out. Over time some scars will almost disappear and sometimes corrective cosmetic surgery can be done to further minimize their appearance. A general rule of thumb is: if the full thickness of skin have been disrupted - there will be a scar. If the wound is managed well, it will scar less.Scars are part of your normal skin, and while they are remodeled over time, this is a very slow process. The bigger the scar, the longer it takes to be remodeled. That's why major scars will usually never heal back to normal.",為什麼幾乎無法擺脫疤痕？,疤痕組織與正常皮膚不同。它包含的膠原蛋白比常規組織更多，並且與普通皮膚相同，這就是為什麼看起來如此不同的原因。它也不太靈活。擁有疤痕組織的好處是，身體可以從傷口中恢復出異常恢復 - 許多動物不能產生疤痕組織，因此傷口可以保持更長的時間，並且更容易受到感染和其他問題的影響。相反，其他動物可以再生整個四肢，而我們不能再生。有趣的是，您的疤痕組織中的膠原蛋白會不斷更換。如果您的身體停止產生膠原蛋白，那麼您的疤痕傷口實際上可能會重新打開。由於組織的結構/有序形式比您的常規皮膚較少，但是存在一些醫療程序以減少這種效果，因此很難擺脫疤痕。當人體癒合時，以隨機模式在正常和健康的組織中發現的膠原蛋白以更有條理的方式形成。這允許癒合，但因為它與正常皮膚不同 - 它脫穎而出。隨著時間的流逝，一些疤痕幾乎會消失，有時可以進行矯正的整容手術，以進一步最大程度地減少其外觀。一般的經驗法則是：如果皮膚的全部厚度被破壞了 - 會有疤痕。如果傷口的控制良好，它將減少疤痕。尺度是您正常皮膚的一部分，並且隨著時間的推移進行改建，這是一個非常緩慢的過程。疤痕越大，重塑所需的時間越長。這就是為什麼主要疤痕通常永遠不會恢復正常的原因。
How does a linear induction motor work?,"Alright, the only word in there you gotta worry about is 'induction'. 'Motor' just means it moves stuff, and 'linear' just means it moves stuff in a straight line . As for 'induction': When you've got electricity moving, it can create a magnetic field . That magnetic field can move stuff like you could with a magnet if you work the electric current just right. How do you work it just right? Well you basically line up a row of electromagnets ~~and turn them on/off as they move along the iron stator so that the magnets are always getting pulled forward.~~ This kind of motor has two main advantages. One is that since nothing needs to be touching, you reduce friction, so things can go faster. The other is that the motor doesn't need much in the way of moving parts since it's all electricity, so things don't wear out as fast. Does that help? EDIT: See later post. Read a few things wrong in my first read of the pdf.Look at a row of movie marqee ""chase"" lights.It is fundamentally the same thing, except instead of light bulbs it uses electro magnets, and the ""lit"" one draws the magnet to it, and as it ""chases"", the next one activates, drawing the magnet.",線性感應電動機如何工作？,好吧，您唯一要擔心的是“歸納”。“馬達”只是意味著它移動東西，而“線性”只是意味著它會直線移動。至於“感應”：當電力移動時，它會產生磁場。如果您正確使用右電流，則該磁場可以像磁鐵一樣移動東西。您如何工作正確？好吧，您基本上是將一排電磁體排成一排，然後將它們沿鐵定子移動時將它們打開/關閉，以使磁鐵始終向前拉。~~這種電動機具有兩個主要優勢。一個是，由於沒有任何觸摸需要觸摸，您可以減少摩擦，因此情況可以更快。另一個是，由於所有電力，電動機不需要運動部件的方式太多，因此事情不會磨損那麼快。這有幫助嗎？編輯：請參閱以後的帖子。在我第一次閱讀PDF時，請閱讀一些錯誤磁鐵和它的“追逐”時，下一個激活，繪製磁鐵。
"Does time ever end, or is the future infinite?","That's a really good question, as if deals with the metaphysical in a physical context; basically, the universe will end before time ends, so we have no real way of knowing. However, one could argue that time will end when physical existence ends; in that case, the end of time will come with the end of the Universe.It’s hard to say. Time isn’t steady, it’s fluid and changes depending on things like where you are and how fast you’re going. If you go the speed of light, time doesn’t exist. If you go close to a super massive black hole, time can be infinitely slow. As for if time will ever end, it depends on if/how the universe ends. If the universe keeps expanding, it will get to the point where it expands so fast nothing will be able to touch anymore, at which time, time will be irrelevantWell time itself is a human-made construct, so “time” will exist as long as humans choose to use it. As for the future in general, there’s no evidence of every type of matter ever ceasing to exist all at once, meaning it will be infinite.",時間會結束，還是未來的無限？,這是一個非常好的問題，好像在物理背景下處理形而上學。基本上，宇宙將在時間結束之前結束，因此我們沒有真正的了解方式。但是，人們可能會說，當物理存在結束時，時間將結束。在這種情況下，時間的終結將隨著宇宙的末端而臨時。這很難說。時間不穩定，流暢，並且會根據您的位置和前進的速度而變化。如果您達到光的速度，則不存在時間。如果您接近超大的黑洞，時間可能會無限緩慢。至於如果時間會結束，則取決於宇宙如何結束。如果宇宙不斷擴展，它將達到如此迅速擴展的地步，再也無法觸摸，在此時間，時間將是無關緊要的時間本身就是一個人為的結構，因此“時間”就會存在當人類選擇使用它時。至於未來，沒有證據表明每種類型的物質都停止了，這將是無限的。

"In English, what is the rule for the use of “An” or “A”","An is used for words that start with a vowel sound. Examples, An owl, an hour, an eight, an apple, an onion.

Note this is how the word sounds, not how it's spelled. 'Unicorn' starts with a y sound, so you say 'a unicorn'. The h in 'honor' is silent, so you say 'an honor'.",用英語，使用“ AN”或“ A”的規則是什麼,一個用於以元音聲音開頭的單詞。例子，貓頭鷹，一個小時，一個八，一個蘋果，一個洋蔥。A用於所有其他人。它與意義無關。這與單詞的聲音有關。如果一個單詞以元音聲音開頭，則使用“ an”，否則，使用“ a”。請注意，這是單詞聽起來的方式，而不是拼寫方式。“獨角獸”以y聲音開頭，所以你說“一個獨角獸”。“榮譽”中的h是沉默的，所以你說“榮譽”。
Why do we have two small nostrils and not one larger nostril?,"It's usually not noticeable unless you sniff harshly, but one nostril is usually more open and free-flowing than the other. The nostril that's closed usually swaps back and forth after several hours throughout the day. When a nostril is more closed, it's swollen, because the blood vessels inside the nose are swollen. During that time, your immune system attacks all the nasty stuff that came into your nose. It's harder to breathe when that happens. But your other nostril is wide open and maximum air comes in. This combination of having one closed nostril and one open nostril is a super efficient way for your body to both clean the nasties and breathe full air at the same time. If it was all just 1 nostril, then every few hours you would have difficulty breathing. Air breathed through the nostrils are combined in the back and flow into both longs. One nostril does not lead into one lung.It is assumed that it has something to do with the Nasal Cycle. Having two Nostrils allows more efficiency for your Immune system. Excluding when you have colds, at least one nostril is always open for airflow. Although not as noticeable unless you have a cold, your Immune system has the ability to ""Clean"" up the Nose's air filter while still having the ability to breathe through one nostril. Perhaps it may also be related to the sense of smell, we have two of our major sensory organs such as eyes and our ears. Having two may better detect/locate smells.",為什麼我們有兩個小鼻孔，而沒有一個較大的鼻孔？,除非您嚴厲地嗅探，否則通常不會明顯，但是一個鼻孔通常比另一個鼻孔更開放和自由流動。關閉的鼻孔通常在整天幾個小時後來回交換。當鼻孔更閉合時，它會腫脹，因為鼻子內部的血管腫脹。在此期間，您的免疫系統會攻擊所有討厭的東西。發生這種情況時很難呼吸。但是您的另一個鼻孔是開放的，最大的空氣進來。擁有一個封閉的鼻孔和一個開放的鼻孔的組合是您身體同時清潔鼻子和呼吸全空氣的超級有效方法。如果全部只有1個鼻孔，那麼每隔幾個小時就會難以呼吸。通過鼻孔呼吸的空氣被合併在背面，並流入兩個較長的態度。一個鼻孔不會導致一個肺。假定它與鼻週期有關。擁有兩個鼻孔可以為您的免疫系統提高效率。除了感冒時，至少有一個鼻孔始終為氣流開放。儘管除非感冒，否則您的免疫系統不太明顯，但您的免疫系統能夠“清潔”鼻子的空氣濾清器，同時仍然能夠通過一個鼻孔呼吸。也許它也可能與嗅覺有關，我們有兩個主要的感覺器官，例如眼睛和耳朵。有兩個可以更好地檢測/定位氣味。
Why do car rims appear to be rotating backwards after a car accelerates?,"/r/flooey is partially correct. That is the reason wheels appear to move backwards on film. This effect can be leveraged with a stroboscope [for an odd illusion] even in real life, by imitating the film effect and only allowing your eyes to see individual 'frames' in time. However, as you probably noticed , this happens in real life as well, under continuous lighting. Excitingly, we don't really know why this happens! There are [two competing theories] at the moment. One is basically that visual perception actually does act like a camera, and only processes small snapshots at a time. However, later experiments found that this explanation fails in several circumstances. The hypothesis proposed by those researchers is that this effect is instead to do not with snapshotting of the entire visual system, but a kind of ersatz snapshotting to do with propagation delays in the particular subsystem that does motion detection in the brain .",為什麼在汽車加速後，汽車輪輞似乎在向後旋轉？,/r/flooey部分正確。這就是車輪似乎在電影中向後移動的原因。即使在現實生活中，也可以通過模仿膠卷效果，只允許您的眼睛及時看到單個“框架”，即使在現實生活中，也可以用頻閃儀來利用這種效果。但是，正如您可能注意到的那樣，在連續照明下，這也發生在現實生活中。令人興奮的是，我們真的不知道為什麼會發生這種情況！目前有[兩種競爭理論]。基本上，視覺感知實際上確實像相機一樣起作用，並且一次僅處理小快照。但是，後來的實驗發現這種解釋在幾種情況下失敗了。這些研究人員提出的假設是，這種效果不是要與整個視覺系統的快照，而是一種與特定子系統中確實在大腦中運動檢測的特定子系統的傳播延遲有關的ersatz快照。
How the heck do authorities determine who started a massive fire in the middle of the woods somewhere?,"The first arriving units will most often be at the fire before it gets large, so they can relay to the investigators where the fire was and how big it was when they arrived on scene. Fires will also leave lots of clues as to how fast and hot it burned but also the direction that it came from. There are origin indicators like needle freeze , charring on trees can tell you a lot depending on how intense the fire was when it burned the tree. Grass can fall back towards the origin in a low intensity fire. There could be no soot on a large rock on the opposite side of where the fire came from. Those are just a few examples. As to finding how the fire started they have to look at the origin of the fire which is why you look for that before you start looking for how. Once at the origin, depending on how the fire was started it could be hard easy or impossible to determine. A hot start, where someone just holds a lighter or similar flaming material to the fuel and then takes the lighter and flees is hard to prove. But often times fires don't durn so hot when they first start, depending on many factors, and there could be evidence left behind as to an ignition source. Most accidental fires you can find out who did it either because they confessed or they weren't trying to get away with it so there are witnesses and more evidence. Also most arsonists don't just start ONE fire, they start many. And once there is a known arsonist working an area reports become more general so you can charge him with more fires knowing that you have some that are definitely him and some probably aren't but can't rule him out for it. And for big, expensive, deadly or suspected arsonist fires there will be multiple expert investigators. Source: I'm a fireman that took a couple week long classes on origin and cause determination.

How do film/tv productions handle deaths of actors? Examples?,"Usually it leaves them scrambling.

When John Ritter died he had already taped 3 episodes of the next season of the show he was on, *8 Simple Rules*. They were shown, then on the 4th the writers had his character die and the show became about the remaining characters dealing with his death.",電影/電視節目如何處理演員的死亡？例子？,通常，這會讓他們爭先恐後。我知道約翰·里特（John Ritter）何時死亡，他們實際上不得不將死亡寫入“ 8個簡單規則”。這取決於情況，演員已經拍攝了多少，如果這是一個持續的系列賽。萊格（Ledger）並沒有拍攝過許多博士的場景。當約翰·里特（John Ritter）去世時，他已經錄製了他參加的下一個節目的3集， *8個簡單的規則 *。他們被證明了，然後在第四名作家的角色死亡，演出變成了剩下的角色處理他的死亡。
Does the Sound Increase in Real Life when Someone on Television Increases the Sound?,"The volume control on your laptop or speakers essentially controls the loudest volume you can get - anything that tries to be louder can be distorted. But anything quieter than that is possible. So what might be happening in the movie is that the radio might start at a quarter of the maximum volume level. When they show him turning the dial, they also increase the sound of the radio to half, or three quarters, or full. So it is getting louder, although it can only get up to a certain point. It wouldn't be possible to get your earbuds to be as loud as a rock concert, for example.",當電視上的某人增加聲音時，現實生活中的聲音會增加嗎？,筆記本電腦或揚聲器上的音量控製本質上可以控制您可以獲得的最大音量 - 任何試圖更大聲的東西都可能會扭曲。但是，一切都可以安靜。因此，電影中可能發生的事情是收音機可能以最大音量水平的四分之一開始。當他們向他展示撥號時，他們還將收音機的聲音增加到一半或四分之三，或者滿是滿。因此，它越來越大，儘管它只能達到一定程度。例如，不可能讓您的耳塞像搖滾音樂會一樣響亮。
What would happen if all the countries wiped all the debt incurred by and owed to each other?,Not an expert in the topic but I have some knowledge Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing as it represents a flow of money. This is why the average lifestyle in America is comfortably more lavish than those of in China. This is made possible because Americans are in better position to take out large loans and pay them back in the future. If all the debt were to be wiped out then that would mean banks would lose a very high percentage of income.

How does cutting down trees to plant other vegetation for the purpose of cultivation (such as avocado farming) contribute to global warming?,"When you cut down highly developed forests to replace them with cultivated land you're seriously lowering the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed. A big tree that is several decades old will take in WAY more CO2 than several seedlings that are planted to replace it. Additionally, all of the undergrowth that is in forests absorbs CO2 but that is all removed for farming. Further, a lot of the time what's done is called ""slash and burn"" which means that the forests are chopped down and the debris is cleared away via a controlled fire, once again adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Also, removing well established plants will significantly increase soil erosion and while that may not directly contribute to global warming, it certainly is detrimental to the environment.Ever see an avocado farm? _URL_1_ Ordered, tight, clean.

What happens to Lactose when ingested by Lactose-Intolerants?,"So, from what I've understood in the past, people who are lactose-intolerant aren't able to break down lactose.

Why do people bother keeping savings in banks/currencies which are potentially unstable?,"I see two reasons: 1. In most European countries you need a residence permit to open a bank account. In other words, you must live in the country where you want the bank account. Some countries, like Switzerland, allow foreigners to open bank accounts without a permit. However, the banking fees are high for such customers . Unless people have substantial amounts of money the fees will erase their savings. As it happens, many people in Ukraine are not very wealthy. 2. It is difficult. You need to go abroad, speak a foreign language, spend significant amount of time and money. Most don't bother.People put money in banks for mainly 2 reasons; - Safety; cash is turned into a number on some computer . This is generally better protected than say your own sockdrawer. - Interest; having money in a savings account generally compensates inflation of that money on the account. To put money on a bank abroad prevents you from making large cash withdrawals as you need to be there in person . What annoys me more is that people withdraw their money from banks when they do poorly. All they do, is cause them to go down faster. Sure you may save some of your money, but you are also insured by the bank to regain X% amount of the money on it if they go under Think of all the things that may happen to your money if you keep it under the mattress. *Fire *Wear and tear *Accidental theft/theft with prior knowledge of you having money stashed *Your safety being compromised because so much money is next to you *Loss Risk of keeping your money under a mattress is far greater during stable macro financial times.

how they catch digital pirates who use hotspots or do they?,"Normally, They don't. If they actually want to track down someone who is using a proxy, they will be able to; but for something as harmless as pirating it is not worth their time and money just to find out who you are. Torrents from a hotspot are also not easy to trace back to the user, unless they have a way of identifying you. A lot of hotspot providers would attempt to prevent people from torrenting on their networks, otherwise, they do run the risk of being accused of illegal downloads. I'm not too sure of exactly how the copyright law side of things work though. Off the top of my head, i can remember atleast one case where a guy using mcdonald's internet was arrested for spreading computer viruses, based of the fact that he used his credit card at the store and they had somehow managed to find out exactly which computer was responsible, however, for pirating purposes, its not worth the trouble.I'm surprised no one has mentioned the identifier on your personal device and the ability to change or ""spoof"" it to something else temporarily.",他們如何捕獲使用熱點的數字海盜還是他們？,通常，他們不會。如果他們實際上想追踪使用代理人的人，他們將能夠；但是，對於像盜版這樣無害的事物，不值得他們的時間和金錢來找出自己是誰。除非他們有一種識別您的方式，否則來自熱點的洪流也不容易追溯到用戶。許多熱點提供商會試圖阻止人們在網絡上洪流，否則，他們確實有被指控非法下載的風險。不過，我不太確定事物的版權法方面是如何工作的。在我的頭頂上，我至少記得一種情況，一個使用麥當勞互聯網的人因傳播計算機病毒而被捕，這是因為他在商店使用了信用卡，他們設法確切地找出了哪種計算機但是，出於盜版目的，這是不值得的。

I've been reading up on nukes. Did the Nevada nuclear tests have nuclear winter? Why or why not?,"Nuclear Winter is not a local effect resulting from an atomic blast, but rather a hypothetical effect from lots of nukes going off. The theory is that the nukes would kick a lot of soot and dust up in to the air, blocking out the sun. The blocking out of the sun would result in lower temperatures since the sun can't heat up as much of the Earth anymore. Some of the effects are based on similar effects felt when a large volcano goes off. Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines went off in the early 90's and we only saw a slight drop in temperature .No. The concept of nuclear winter is that if a bunch of nukes all went off in a short period of time the amount of dust put into the air would reduce the global temperature because they would block out sunlight. The reality is if nuclear winter were to happen it would be the least of our worries as full scale nuclear war would have already broken out_URL_0_ Trinity and Beyond movie about early atomic bomb development.

How do we go from binary codes to basic programming languages?,"The lowest level instructions in a computer are the instructions of the CPU architecture. This varies between CPUs but there's two main ones currently: x86 used by Intel and AMD processors, and the one used by ARM processors. These instructions usually look something like ""MOV 1, 2"" which might mean to take the number stored in memory location 1 and copy it to memory location 2. Or you might have ""ADD 1, 2, 3"" which adds the two numbers at 1, 2 and puts the result in 3. When you hear about binary being the lowest level in a computer, it's just a binary encoding of these CPU instructions. So MOV might be 001 and ADD is 010, then the memory locations are represented as binary numbers after the type of instruction. When you hear about a 32-bit or 64-bit processor, that's how many bits each CPU instruction is.",我們如何從二進制代碼到基本的編程語言？,計算機中的最低級別說明是CPU體系結構的說明。這在CPU之間有所不同，但目前有兩個主要的CPU：Intel和AMD處理器使用的X86，以及ARM處理器使用的X86。這些說明通常看起來像“ mov 1，2”，可能意味著將存儲在內存位置1中的數字進行複製到內存位置2。或者您可能有“添加1、2、3”，該數字添加了兩個數字1，2並將結果放在3中。因此，MOV可能是001，並且添加為010，然後將內存位置表示為指令類型後的二進制數字。當您聽到有關32位或64位處理器的信息時，每種CPU指令就是多少位。

Why do posts on reddit not start on 0 (what's the purpose of allowing one to vote for oneself)?,"To reward you for making a comment even if no one else doesSo you have the satisfaction of having a +1 post and another person has the satisfaction of down voting that satisfaction from you.When your post gets upvoted, its ranking goes up using what's called a [logarithm]. Basically, the more upvotes a post has, the less each new upvote pushes it up a page in proportion to how many points it already has. Going from 1 point to 2 is as helpful as going from 10 points to 20, or 500 to 1000. The thing is, this model breaks down when you get zero points so when Reddit calculates how high up the post should appear, it treats a post with 0 points the same as one with 1 point. If you really started at zero points, then the first upvote your post gets would have no effect, since it has to treat 0 points as 1 point anyway! Reddit's current solution is to have you automatically start at 1 point, so as soon as someone sees your post and likes it, they can make it go higher in the rankings by upvoting it. If there was no automatic self-upvote, then people who don't choose to upvote themselves would be worse off. Another way to fix that would be to just make it so you can't upvote your own posts at all, but then you would need two upvotes before you start going up in the rankings, making it a little harder to sort out the good posts from the bad ones. Edit: I think I read that you don't get karma from your self upvotes anyway, so you can't keep making useless posts to get more karma.",為什麼Reddit上的帖子不在0開始（允許人們投票給自己的目的是什麼）？,為了獎勵您發表評論，即使沒有其他人doesso，您對擁有+1的帖子和另一個人的滿意感到滿意。一個[對數]。基本上，帖子的投票越多，每個新的upvote的投票就越少，將其推向一個頁面，其與已經有多少點的觀點成比例。從1點到2與從10分到20點或500到1000的有用。事實是，當您獲得零點時，此型號會崩潰以0分與1分相同。如果您真的從零點開始，那麼您的帖子獲得的第一個投票將沒有效果，因為它必須將0分作為1分！Reddit的當前解決方案是讓您從1點開始自動開始，因此，一旦有人看到您的帖子並喜歡它，他們就可以通過上漲來使其在排名中變得更高。如果沒有自動自動投票，那麼不選擇自己投票的人會變得更糟。修復的另一種方法就是做到這一點，這樣您就不能完全投票自己的帖子，但是在開始排名之前，您將需要兩個投票來自壞的。編輯：我想我讀到您無論如何都不會從自我投票中獲得業力，因此您無法繼續發表無用的帖子來獲得更多的業力。
"if you light a lighter in front of a TV, why does the reflection show 4 tiny rainbows around the flame?","This is to do with, not the display itself, but the layers of diffusers that make up the backlight behind the display An LCD TV consists of a backlight and an LCD panel. The backlight's job is to produce an even spread of light across the display. You first have an array of LEDs, but those LEDs are point sources, and you don't want lots of bright dots. So the light has to be spread out. They do this with sheets of plastic etched with fine lines. These lines bend the light and spread it out - but only in one direction. If you only had one of these sheets, you'd have an array of lines, one for each LED. So instead they use many sheets, each sheet with lines at an angle to the one beneath. With enough of them, the light is spread evenly. It is these fine lines etched into plastic that produces those rainbows. Each line reflects the light of your lighter when the angle is right. You get a spot of light from each line, which makes a line of light stretching away from the reflection of the lighter. But the lines are close enough that you get interference - as the angle increases, the distance the light has to travel between scratches increases, and you find places where, for one color of light, the distance the light travels is exactly one-half wavelength, so the peaks of the light waves line up with the troughs, and cancel out. When you cancel out one color of light, then you only see the other colors. This is the same effect that gives CDs and DVDs their rainbow appearance. And this explanation is way too long.",如果您在電視面前點亮一個打火機，為什麼反射會在火焰周圍顯示4個小彩虹？,這與顯示本身有關，而是構成顯示器背後的背光的擴散器的層，LCD電視由背光和LCD面板組成。背光的工作是在顯示屏上產生均勻的光線。您首先有各種各樣的LED，但是這些LED是點源，您不想要很多明亮的點。因此，必須散開光線。他們用用細紋蝕刻的塑料片來做到這一點。這些線彎曲了光並將其散佈 - 但僅在一個方向上。如果您只有這些床單之一，則有一系列的線路，每個LED。因此，他們使用了許多床單，每張床單都與下面的線一定角度。有足夠的燈光，光線均勻散開。正是這些蝕刻成塑料的細紋產生了這些彩虹。當角度正確時，每條線都會反射打火機的光。您會從每條線中獲得一點點，這使一條光線遠離打火機的反射。但是線條足夠接近以至於您會受到干擾 - 隨著角度的增加，光線之間的距離在划痕之間增加的距離，並且您可以找到一種位置，因此，光波的峰與槽排成一致，然後取消。當您取消一種顏色的光線時，您只會看到其他顏色。這與CD和DVD的彩虹外觀相同。這種解釋太長了。
How does copyright work with references?,"US copyright has a Fair Use clause, which a minor reference like the ones you are mentioning fall under.

As to when you cross the line of fair use, that's subjective and really you have to use your best judgment. _URL_0_ has more info.It depends on how it's done, but most cases of what you describe would fall under fair use. Fair use is a legal right that allows you to use certain parts of a copyrighted work so long as your use meets certain criteria. One of the biggest distinctions is whether or not you're competing with the copyright owner's market share by using the copyrighted work. A reference to a TV show or video game that shows up in a written book isn't going to provide consumers with a substitute for the actual TV show or video game, so that would generally fall under fair use. However, if you reproduced substantial portions of the actual script for the movie in the book, that would probably not be covered by fair use because the copyright owner could argue that reading this script may serve as a substitute for seeing the movie, and therefore threatens to reduce the owner's ability to profit from their copyrighted work.",版權如何與參考資料一起使用？,美國版權有一個合理的用法條款，次要參考如您所提及的條款。您不需要為“我曾經在《星際迷航》上看到過這樣的東西看到了這樣的東西！”或“這就像原始系列的第79集，Turnabout Intuder！他們被燒毀了！”至於您跨越合理使用的界限，這是主觀的，實際上您必須使用最佳判斷。_url_0_有更多信息。這取決於它的完成方式，但是您所描述的大多數情況都會屬於公平用途。合理使用是一項合法權利，只要您的用途符合某些標準，就可以使用受版權保護的工作的某些部分。最大的區別之一是您是否使用受版權保護的工作與版權所有者的市場份額競爭。在書面書中出現的電視節目或視頻遊戲的引用不會為消費者提供替代實際的電視節目或視頻遊戲，因此通常會公平使用。但是，如果您重現了本書中電影的實際腳本的大量部分，那麼這可能不會被合理使用，因為版權所有者可能會爭辯說，閱讀此腳本可能是看電影的替代品，因此威脅要威脅降低所有者從受版權保護的工作中獲利的能力。

You could be using cunt like the Aussies do in friendly conversation , but someone who isn't used to hearing that can still take offense to it.",為什麼在美國，“ c”這個詞這樣的禁忌詞？,人們做到了。可以根據文化中的使用方式來賦予這種力量。我記得當奧斯汀·鮑爾斯2（Austin Powers 2）出來時，這對英國人民來說很庸俗。在美國，張開是一個可愛的詞。請記住，這是採取的方式，而不是預期的方式。您可能會像澳大利亞人在友好的談話中一樣使用unt，但是一個不習慣聽到的人仍然會冒犯它。
why is it so easy for people to start working out regularly but it’s hard to stop eating certain foods or cutting back?,"Human being are designed to eat as much food as they possibly can, because in nature food is a whole lot rarer.

Why is the USA drinking age set at 21 when in most other respects you're an adult at 18.,"In the 60s and 70s, the US had a **lot** of fatalities as a result of teenage drunk driving. Waaay more than any other country did. Really, there were two options available to them: raise the drinking age, or raise the driving age. I think they made the right choice.As someone already said it was because of the drunk driving problem. However it's worth noting that that drop it drunk driving was so staggering with the new limit that it'd be political suicide to try and change it back.It was 21 for a long time. Then back in the 1970s, a lot of states lowered it to 18. And the drunk driving deaths immediately shot up. So Congress raised it back upIt is, from wikipedia: > The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 was passed on July 17, 1984 by the United States Congress. It punished every state that allowed persons below 21 years to purchase and publicly possess alcoholic beverages by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by ten percent.It's a reasonable question. After all, U.S. citizens are deemed adult enough to be licensed to drive a vehicle, to vote, or to join the military anddie for their country at 18.",為什麼在大多數其他方面，您是18歲的成年人，為什麼美國的飲酒年齡設定為21歲。,在60年代和70年代，由於十幾歲的醉酒駕駛，美國造成了一陣死亡。Waaay比任何其他國家都多。確實，他們有兩種選擇：提高飲酒年齡或提高駕駛年齡。我認為他們做出了正確的選擇。正如有人已經說過是因為酒後駕車問題。然而，值得注意的是，掉落的酒後駕車是如此驚人，新的限制是試圖重新改變它是政治上的自殺。這是21歲。然後在1970年代，許多州將其降低到18歲。因此，國會將其備份起來是來自維基百科：>美國國會於1984年7月17日通過了1984年的《全國最低飲酒年齡法》。它通過將其年度聯邦高速公路分配降低10％來懲罰每個州，允許21歲以下的人購買並公開擁有酒精飲料。這是一個合理的問題。畢竟，美國公民被認為是足夠的成年人，可以被許可駕駛車輛，投票或加入軍隊和迪在18歲時為自己的國家 /地區加入。
Why do I not smell perfume I've sprayed on me but other people do?,"Why don't you see your nose? It's within your vision. Your brain filters out your nose, because it's always there, and likewise, it filters out smells that are ""always there"". The phenomenon is called [sensory adaptation], this is the brain caring less about constant stimuli. Olfactory neurons also fire less frequently.You probably just get used to it, so your brain tunes it out as background noise and then you can't smell it anymore.",為什麼我不聞到我在我身上噴灑的香水，而是其他人呢？,你為什麼看不到鼻子？這是您的視野。您的大腦會過濾鼻子，因為它始終存在，並且同樣，它會過濾出“始終在那裡”的氣味。該現象稱為[感覺適應]，這是大腦關心恆定刺激的關心。嗅覺神經元也較少發射。您可能只是習慣了它，因此您的大腦將其調整為背景噪音，然後再也無法聞到它了。
How does a two headed reptile/siamese twins work? How do they move their bodies assuming there are two brains?,"Typically each twin controls a different part of the body. Like the twin girls Brittany and Abigail Hensel. They give the appearance of being one body with two heads, though they have two of each organ above the waist. They have two arms, each controlling one. And from the waist down, they have one body, with each controlling one half. So each controls a leg, for example. There doesn't appear to be any part that both of their brains controls. So they coordinate with each other so that they can walk, but they each have their own body parts they use. In some cases of animals with two heads, only one head ""works"". The other head doesn't seem to have any reactions to stimuli so it's vestigial.",兩個頭爬行動物/暹羅雙胞胎如何工作？假設有兩個大腦，他們如何移動身體？,通常每個雙胞胎控制身體的另一部分。就像雙胞胎女孩布列塔尼和阿比蓋爾·亨瑟爾一樣。他們的外觀是一個有兩個頭的身體，儘管它們的每個器官都上方有兩個。他們有兩個手臂，每個手臂控制一隻。從腰部向下，它們有一個身體，每個身體都控制了一半。因此，每個都控制腿。他們的兩個大腦似乎都沒有任何部分。因此，他們彼此協調，以便他們可以走路，但是每個人都有自己使用的身體部位。在某些情況下，有兩個頭部的動物，只有一個頭“作品”。另一頭似乎對刺激沒有任何反應，因此它是殘留的。
How do human voices work? What makes our voices seem so unique?,"Finally a question that being a voice major has equipped me to answer! : Air passes from your lungs in between your vocal folds . They're quite tiny and produce a tiny sound. Cartilage around them can manipulate/stretch them to make them thinner or thicker . That small bit of sound that they make while vibrating is amplified by the natural cavities in your head: your throat, your mouth, and your sinuses. The way that you manipulate those cavities produces the other qualities to the sound, such as the volume, nasality, and very importantly, sounding like different vowels or voiced consonants. Some consonants are produced with only air . I would assume the reason why everything we say sounds different from other types of sound is that we train ourselves constantly from an early age to pay attention and sort patterns out of speech sounds versus other types of sound.",人的聲音如何工作？是什麼使我們的聲音看起來如此獨特？,最後，一個問題是我的聲音使我能夠回答！：空氣從您的肺部散發出來。它們很小，會產生微小的聲音。它們周圍的軟骨可以操縱/拉伸，使其更薄或更厚。它們在振動時發出的一小部分聲音被您的頭部自然腔擴大：您的喉嚨，嘴和鼻竇。操縱這些空腔的方式會產生其他品質，例如音量，鼻腔，非常重要的是，聽起來像不同的元音或配音輔音。一些輔音只用空氣產生。我認為我們所說的一切聲音與其他類型的聲音不同的原因是，我們從小就不斷地訓練自己，以注意語音與其他類型的聲音從語音中分類出來。
"why aren't AK47's an ""accurate"" rifle","1. AK-47's distance between the sight and post is very short which makes it so that for longer ranges, it is extremely difficult to line up an accurate shot as you are more likely to be misaligned with your eye to the sights. 2. It uses a relatively low velocity round, meaning it arcs more and spends more time to get to the target, making it deviate more from environmental conditions 3. Its feeding mechanism uses very large and heavy moving parts which reduces accuracy dramatically from recoil. 4. It has a more significant recoil upon firing due to its type of ammunition, making subsequent rounds less accurate. 5. It operates on a lot looser tolerances, while making it more reliable, also reduces its overall accuracy. 6. [Its gun barrel flexes more than other guns during recoil.] Compare that with [this], Or [this] 7. The barrel isn't inline with the stock, making recoils want to push the gun upwards.they are ..the round the fire, 7.62x39 is however sometimes called the rainbow round because it takes quite an arc after a few hundred meters. This, however doesnt mean the gun wont shoot straight, or you cant make longer shots, you just have to compensate. It probably gets that rep because its available and cheap so often poorly trained people are using it.US Special Forces soldiers in Vietnam described it like this: The American rifles and ammunition are like supermodels. Pretty, slender and shapely, and great at what they do until you get them wet or dirty. Russian weapons are like Russian women, tough, dependable, and built to work. You can drop an AK47 in the mud, wipe it off, and it's ready to go back to work.",為什麼AK47不是“準確”步槍,1. AK-47在視線和郵寄之間的距離非常短，因此，對於更長的範圍來說，將準確的鏡頭排隊非常困難，因為您更有可能將目光偏向景點。2.它使用相對較低的速度回合，這意味著它更多地弧形，並花費更多的時間到達目標，使其與環境條件更加偏離3.其餵養機制使用非常大且重型移動的部件，從而從後坐力大大降低了準確性。4.由於其彈藥的類型，它在射擊後具有更明顯的後坐力，因此隨後的回合的準確性降低了。5.它以更寬鬆的公差運行，同時使其更可靠，也降低了其整體準確性。6. [它的槍桶比在後坐力期間比其他槍支更彎曲。]將與[this]或[this]]的7.相比。.槍管不與庫存內聯，使後坐力希望向上推動槍支。。但是，這並不意味著槍不會直接射擊，否則您無法進行更長的鏡頭，您只需要補償即可。它可能會得到該代表，因為它可用且便宜，因此訓練有素的人通常都在使用它。越南的特種部隊士兵這樣說：美國步槍和彈藥就像超模一樣。漂亮，苗條，整齊，並且擅長於他們所做的事情，直到您弄濕它們或骯髒為止。俄羅斯武器就像俄羅斯婦女一樣，堅強，可靠，可以工作。您可以將AK47放在泥濘中，擦掉它，然後可以返回工作。
Why can I not remember what happens when I'm drunk?,"Memories enter the brain first as short term memory, that is then transformed into a long-term memory. This is evident because the majority of short-term memories that we experience are lost before they ever make it into what we will call ""long-term"" storage. When alcohol is consumed it affects your ability to take short-term memories and transform them into long-term memories. This is why you only may remember small bits and pieces of the night, these are the select short-term memories that were allowed to settle into long-term ones without the interruption of alcohol. As the level of alcohol drops, the number of memories that make it into ""long-term\' storage increases.",為什麼我不記得我喝醉時會發生什麼？,記憶首先以短期內存進入大腦，然後將其轉變為長期記憶。這很明顯，因為我們所經歷的大多數短期記憶都在將其納入我們所說的“長期”存儲之前就消失了。當酒精消耗時，它會影響您獲得短期記憶並將其轉變為長期記憶的能力。這就是為什麼您可能只記得夜晚的小零碎的原因，這些是允許在不中斷酒精的情況下安頓成長期的短期記憶。隨著酒精水平的下降，使其進入“長期\”存儲的記憶數量增加。
Isn't the freshwater we have to work with just going in a cycle? How are we losing fresh water?,"When the water ends up in the oceans, it slows down the cycling a lot. Water in aquifers and water on Earth's surface are the cheapest to use. We have been either polluting these or using them too fast for new water to filter in. We have also allowed a lot of water to go to the ocean , rather than slowly go into the aquifers through the ground. So the result is we are using aquifer water faster than they are getting refilled. When that water is depleted, all water will become more expensive. We will still have it, but it will either be salty, polluted, or far from where it needs to be, and all of the fixes for this cost money.Sorry if this isn't too coherent, I haven't finished my first cup of coffee for the day.",我們不是只需要在周期中就可以工作的淡水嗎？我們如何失去淡水？,當水最終到達海洋時，它會減慢騎自行車的速度。含水層中的水和地球表面的水是最便宜的。我們要么污染它們，要么使用它們太快，無法將新水過濾。我們還允許大量水進入海洋，而不是慢慢地通過地面進入含水層。因此，結果是我們使用的含水層水比重新填充的速度更快。當水耗盡時，所有水都會變得更加昂貴。我們仍然會擁有它，但是它要么咸，污染或遠離需要的地方，而且所有的修理費用都是花錢的。一杯咖啡一天。
Why is there such a large Insane Clown Posse (Juggalo) following?,"A lot of it is because the group tries to make its fans into a ""community"" . Like, fans of a band like, say, the Black Keys, are just people who happen to like the Black Keys. But ICP specifically encourages fans, ""Hey, dress up like us, be like us, be part of something,"" and then the fans encourage each other to do it too. People like that. They like feeling like they're part of a group. It's the same kind of thing with Lady Gaga and her ""Little Monsters,"" just a different type of music.ICP seems to be really popular in weird suburbs where there isn't shit else to do except all the things that a true juggalo does . But Keego Harbor, Pontiac, and Del Ray in Michigan fit that description pretty well.They formed a community for societies rejects. Very little of it actually has to do with their music thoughBecause there are a lot of followers in the world who desperately need something to belong to, no matter how lame.They really play off of kids that don't feel like they belong.

"Why metal at room temperature feels cold while, say, fabric at room temperature doesn't","I believe it has something to do with the rate at which heat from your body is transferred to the material.

"What are those bastardly little tongue sores you get from eating too much salt or sugar, and how do you get rid of them?","The condition is called aphthous stomatitis, or commonly, canker sores. They are NOT inflamed tastebuds. Rather, they are small ulcers that are characteristically painful and confined to the mucosa of the mouth by definition. There is no cure, but many over-the-counter drugs are sold that can mitigate the pain caused by them. This question is by no means explained . Rather, the pathogenesis of an aphthous sore is still unknown. I couldn't believe it, but apparently this is an area of relatively active research. [This] recent review article provides some nice context. [This question] has been asked many times before.

Why are swearing words related to genitals and/or sexuality?,"Swear words come from things we consider taboo or distasteful. In English-speaking society, we have a lot of taboos surrounding sex, even in this day and age. We also put a very high level of importance on hygiene, so words relating to waste and where they come from are also taboo. Certain words automatically make your brain think of a subject in a more intense way than others. A colloquial term vs a scientific one. This is true for pretty much anything, even if it isn't a swearword -- sweat vs perspiration, for example. When it's a topic that's taboo, that word becomes a swear. When it isn't, it moves back into innocuous territory.",為什麼宣誓單詞與生殖器和/或性行為有關？,發誓單詞來自我們認為禁忌或令人反感的事情。在講英語的社會中，即使在當今時代，我們也有很多禁忌。我們還對衛生提出了很高的重要性，因此與浪費有關的單詞以及它們來自何處也是禁忌。某些單詞會自動使您的大腦以比其他人更激烈的方式思考主題。通言術語與科學術語。對於幾乎任何事物來說都是如此，即使不是髒話 - 例如汗水與汗水。當這是一個禁忌的話題時，這個詞就會發誓。如果不是這樣，它就會回到無害的領域。

How do street lights know when cars are there?,"There's a couple ways that traffic lights know there are cars there. The first is sensors under the road.

Other traffic lights use cameras to actually detect cars with image recognition, but there are still pretty rare and are generally put in to do double-duty as red-light cameras or traffic monitoring. There's a few around that use infrared motion detectors but I actually haven't seen any in a while, they might be phased out. As far as the boxes on top it may be part of a system emergency vehicles use.

The size of the universe.,"There's more than one way to measure cosmological distances. One way is to use what's called the ""lookback distance."" It's just the distance measured in units of time. If light from an galaxy has been in transit for a billion years, then you can quite accurately say that galaxy is a billion years away. The other way to measure distances is to imagine that you could somehow magically stop time and stretch a very long ruler across the distance you're measuring. This is called the *instantaneous proper distance.* It's used much less often, because it's not a *useful* number to calculate. You *can't* stop time or stretch a ruler across those kinds of distances, so the number you get from that kind of calculation is really only a particularly obscure type of trivia. So the radius of the observable universe is both about 14 billion years and about 46 billion light-years. Both statements are equally true. We know the age of the universe because we can look at the temperature of the sky and see how much it's cooled since the end of the Big Bang, and we can look at the rate of metric expansion and see how it relates to pressure. And you're thinking of metric expansion quite wrongly. It's not that there's a wall out there that's moving away from us. It's that *all distances in the universe* vary with time. Not because things move, but because the *geometry of the universe* is itself a function of time. Right now, it's estimated with quite a high degree of precision that all distances in the universe are increasing at about seventy kilometers per second per megaparsec.I'm sorry that I don't know how to answer your question, but I would like to post this here: _URL_0_ Space Engine, kind of like google Earth, but a map of the entire Universe.

How did the Romans express numbers in speech and/or calculation?,"This is a really good question, you should probably chuck it over onto /r/AskHistorians, they 'd be more likely to have an actual, factual answer. EDIT: Someone has already asked it over there, the best answer last year came from /u/rosemary85 and goes as follows: > No. The Latin words for numbers are fairly similar to those in modern Romance languages .The Latin for 94 is quattuor et nonaginta, literally ""four and ninety"", or alternatively nonaginta et quattuor.The exceptions are that the Latin for 18 and 19 are duodeviginti and undeviginti, literally ""twenty minus two"" and ""twenty minus one"". But as you can see, this has nothing at all to do with how the numerals were written.I should perhaps note that the Romans very often wrote IIII and VIIII rather than IV and IX for ""four"" and ""nine"", XXXX rather than XL for ""forty"", etc. I don't have statistics at my fingertips, but I believe the IIII/XXXX forms were actually more common than the IV/XL forms that are preferred nowadays. [See here for the rest of the comments.]",羅馬人如何在語音和/或計算中表達數字？,這是一個非常好的問題，您可能應該將其納入 /R /AskHistorians上，他們更有可能具有實際的事實答案。編輯：有人已經問過它，去年的最佳答案來自 /u /u /rosemary85，如下：>編號。數字的拉丁語單詞與現代浪漫語言中的拉丁語單詞相似。et nonaginta，字面意思是“四個和九十”，或者是nonaginta et quttuor。例外是18和19的拉丁語是duodeviginti和undeviginti，字面上是“二十個負二”和“二十個”。但是，如您所見，這與數字的編寫方式無關。我也許應該注意，羅馬書經常寫IIII和VIIII，而不是IV和IX，而IX和IX則為“四”和“ nine”，xxxx而不是XL的“四十”等。我的指尖沒有統計數據，但我相信IIII/XXXX表格實際上比如今首選的IV/XL表單更為常見。[有關其餘的評論，請參見此處。]
What's the difference between Genetic Drift and Natural Selection?,"Both of these concepts deal with traits within a population changing over time. With natural selection, one trait is more advantageous, so organisms with that trait survive and reproduce more effectively, resulting in more organisms with that trait. Genetic drift is when a trait becomes more common within a population due to luck. For example, pretend we have a group of humans and some of them possess a genetic code that gives them green hair. If green hair is considered attractive, then those with the trait will be able to mate more and have more children. This is a benefit resulting from the trait being preferred. This means that nature selects positively for this trait and it is supported by natural selection. On the other hand, let's again pretend that there's a trait for green hair but nobody finds it particularly attractive or unattractive. Logically, there's no reason why it should become particularly popular or unpopular. However, one day, a bunch of brown-haired people gather for a meeting in a building that catches on fire and they all die, while the green-haired people outside are unharmed. This event makes green hair more prominent within the population but it wasn't a direct result of any properties related to green hair. Since this was green hair becoming more common as a result of random events, this would be considered an example of genetic drift. TL;DR: Natural selection means the trait itself is beneficial, making it more popular. Genetic drift is when a trait just happens to become more popular, even though there's nothing advantageous about the trait.",遺傳漂移和自然選擇有什麼區別？,這兩個概念都涉及人群中隨著時間的變化的特徵。有了自然選擇，一個特徵更有利，因此具有該特徵的生物可以更有效地生存和繁殖，從而導致更多的生物體具有該特徵。遺傳漂移是由於運氣在人群中越來越普遍的時候。例如，假裝我們有一群人，其中一些人具有賦予他們綠髮的遺傳密碼。如果認為綠色的頭髮很有吸引力，那麼具有特徵的人將能夠更多地交配並有更多的孩子。這是首選特徵所帶來的好處。這意味著自然可以為此特徵選擇積極，並得到自然選擇的支持。另一方面，讓我們再次假裝有一個綠髮的特徵，但沒有人發現它特別有吸引力或沒有吸引力。從邏輯上講，沒有理由應該特別受歡迎或不受歡迎。但是，有一天，一群棕色頭髮的人聚集在一座著火的建築物中，他們都死了，而外面的綠頭髮人則沒有受到傷害。該事件使綠髮在人群中更加突出，但這並不是與綠髮有關的任何特性的直接結果。由於這是由於隨機事件而變得越來越普遍，因此這將被視為遺傳漂移的一個例子。TL; DR：自然選擇意味著特徵本身是有益的，使其更受歡迎。遺傳漂移是當一個特徵恰好變得更加流行時，即使特徵沒有任何優勢。
Why do professional athletes have a significantly lower pulse than the average person ?,"Because they have increased stroke volume. Their hearts are strengthened so that they are able to move more blood with each pump, so their hearts don't need to pump as many times.You have an empty pool and you need to fill it with water.

I lost weight and took up cycling over the past few years, and my heart rate is down about 15 bpm.* People with exceptional cardiovascular genetics tend to make good athletes.

How do landlords make money,"so essentially making money from letting requires a large amount of time and/or starting capital?', ""You're making the assumption that the market price of the house today is the price for which the landlord bought it. As a resident of the UK you're no doubt aware of the fact that in most parts of the country house prices have increased faster than inflation every year for the past two decades or more. In other words, even if your landlord bought the house only five years ago he'd have paid probably only 80% of its current market value. If he bought it ten years or more ago it would have cost him less than half of what it's currently worth. His mortgage would therefore be much much smaller.Why are you assuming your landlord has a mortgage on the property? If he owns it outright, your £750 pounds is a nice income on that property. If not, it cuts the cost of the mortgage in half, and becomes profitable later on.your landlord probably isn't paying anywhere near that or they simply act as a manager for the property to someone who owns many properties",房東如何賺錢,因此，從本質上講，從放任中賺錢需要大量的時間和/或開始資本？'”，“您正在假設今天房屋的市場價格是房東購買的價格。作為房東的價格。作為居民英國毫無疑問，您知道，在過去二十年或更長的情況下，鄉村房價的大部分地區都比每年通貨膨脹率上漲快。'd只支付了當前市值的80％。如果他購買了十年或更長時間，那將使他不到當前價值的一半。因此，他的抵押貸款將要小得多。您的房東有對該物業的抵押貸款？如果他完全擁有它，您的750英鎊是該物業的不錯收入。如果沒有，則將抵押貸款的成本削減了一半，以後會盈利。t在附近任何地方付款，否則他們只是為擁有許多財產的人擔任該財產的經理

How do spammers spoof a cell phone number to make scam calls?,"When you make an outbound call, the calling system gives the phone system the caller ID information. The reason this can be different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number . The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID. The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things.",垃圾郵件發送者如何欺騙手機號碼以造成騙局？,當您進行出站通話時，呼叫系統會為電話系統提供呼叫者ID信息。這可能與實際呼叫不同的原因是，例如，既有直接線路的業務，又是每個擴展線的直線。召喚的員工將以主線作為呼叫者ID出現，以便如果此人回電，他們將獲得主號碼。垃圾郵件發送者利用該系統來欺騙呼叫者ID中的數字。電話公司可以通過將呼叫者ID信息與您合法擁有的數字進行比較，但是他們為所有這些垃圾郵件呼叫而獲得了很多錢，並且沒有足夠的激勵來改變他們的工作方式。
How do we move our body?,"Planning and decision making for motor movement happens in the [premotor cortex]. To see where it is, find a spot on the top of your head that's about three inches back from your hairline. This is the section in your brain that makes the decisions about lifting limbs and looking at the ceiling. It takes in information from many parts of the brain including the senses, the emotional centers, and long term planning structures before making a decision. When it decides, it sends a command to the [Motor Cortex] which is just a bit closer to the back of the head. The Motor Cortex is a doer. It takes the big decision made by the Pre-Motor Cortex and figures out how to implement it. ""Move your leg!"" says the PMC, and the MC calculates what muscles in what order need to be fired.

What is the difference between a CEO and the President of a company?,"""President"" is a term that is often based on the law of the place where the company is created. For example in the United States, most states require that a corporation have a person with the title President. That title carries with it some legal obligations that tie the individual to the actions of the company. Most jurisdictions don't define or require anyone to hold the title ""Chief Executive Officer"". Depending on the size of the entity, the President and the CEO may be the same person. Large entities may be comprised of several smaller companies, each with a legally required ""President"", who may report to the CEO at the top of the organizational structure. Some companies may separate the two titles for internal organizational reasons, for historical reasons, or because someone thinks it's clever. It is rare for a company to have a CEO who reports to a President. CEO has become the de facto title for ""the highest level of the executive ladder"", but that's arbitrary and fashion could changeCEO is higher. Usually the head of the board of directors. President is often the more hands-on leader of a division or office. As an example the firm I work for has a CEO and a board of directors who are rarely seen, then beneath them are the division presidents - one for each of five state groupings we have. Beneath them are the vice presidents, then the office leaders, then the department managers, then the supervisors and finally the everyday employees. How the leadership is structured will depend on the firm, but the CEO will usually be of a higher rank than the president. In very small firms though, it's not uncommon for the owner to call themselves ""CEO and President"", which basically means they take on both roles.",首席執行官與公司總裁之間有什麼區別？,“總統”是一個術語，通常是基於創建公司的地方的法律。例如，在美國，大多數州都要求公司有一個冠軍主席的人。該標題承擔了一些法律義務，將個人與公司的行為聯繫起來。大多數司法管轄區都不定義或要求任何人持有“首席執行官”。根據實體的規模，總統和首席執行官可能是同一個人。大型實體可能由幾家較小的公司組成，每家公司都有合法要求的“總統”，他們可以向組織結構頂部的首席執行官報告。有些公司出於內部組織原因，出於歷史原因，或者因為有人認為這很聰明。公司很少有一位首席執行官向總統報告。首席執行官已成為“執行階梯的最高水平”的事實上的頭銜，但這是任意的，時尚可以更高。通常是董事會負責人。總統通常是部門或辦公室的動手領導者。例如，我工作的公司有一位首席執行官和董事會很少見到，然後在他們的下面是司總統 - 我們擁有的五個國家組中的每個人。在他們之下，是副總統，然後是辦公室領導人，然後是部門經理，然後是主管，最後是日常員工。領導層的結構如何取決於公司，但首席執行官通常比總統更高。但是，在很小的公司中，所有者稱自己為“首席執行官兼總統”並不少見，這基本上意味著他們都扮演著這兩個角色。
Why does smoking cause some people to lose limbs/develop cancer while there are lifelong smokers who never have these problems?,"The short answer is that at the chemical level biology is very complicated. We tend to think of all sickness and injury the same way we think of, say, a bullet wound---a single, distinct harm that directly interferes with how something in the body works in a simple way. But that's not how all harms work. Nicotine and other carcinogens can cause damage in many ways and at many levels. They can harm cells, different parts of DNA, and different things in different parts of the body. And these harms might not happen every time, or from every puff, depending on random chance. And even when they do cause harm, it might not be enough. Maybe person A has a stronger immune system then person B. Or maybe person B happens to be genetically more vulnerable to cancer than person A. Or maybe person A ends up getting cancer in a cell that happens to get killed the next day by a bacteria, while person B gets it in a cell that survives long enough to grow. There are so many variables between exposure to the toxic substance and the expression of some linked disease that even when the negative health effects are clear---as with smoking---it is almost never going to be the case that everyone will get the same injuries, or even any injury at all.",為什麼吸煙會導致某些人失去四肢/發展癌症，而終身吸煙者從未遇到這些問題？,簡短的答案是，在化學水平上，生物學非常複雜。我們傾向於想像一下子彈傷的所有疾病和傷害 - 一種單一的，獨特的傷害，直接干擾了體內的事物的簡單方式。但這並不是所有傷害的工作方式。尼古丁和其他致癌物可以在許多方面和許多層面上造成損害。它們可以傷害細胞，DNA的不同部分以及身體不同部位的不同事物。這些危害可能並非每次或每次泡芙都會發生，具體取決於隨機的機會。即使它們確實造成傷害，也可能還不夠。也許某人A具有比人更強的免疫系統。，當人B將其放入足夠長以生長的細胞中。暴露於有毒物質和某些連接疾病的表達之間存在太多變量相同的傷害，甚至任何傷害。

Why is it that a hard drive disc can have a capacity of 5TB+ but DVDs can only have a maximum of 9GB?,"In addition to what's already been said about the actual technological differences, one major difference is working conditions. Hard Disks are produced and sealed in clean factories to ensure there is no contamination. They are encased in thick unbend-able metal. From the day you start using it, you can't bend it, get it dirty, scratch it, or really abuse it in any way. The parts inside that rigid case are precisely machined to fit together and be aligned perfectly, and because you can't stick your fingers in there, they stay that way. Precision engineering. Meanwhile DVDs and other similar disks are made from cheap soft easily scratched, easily bent plastic. In use they get coated with your filthy greasy fingerprints. They'll get scratched when you handle them, when your kids put them in the player they'll get jam and cat hair over them. You bend and distort them each time you remove them from the case, and you can put them in a huge variety of players of varying quality. So while the hard disk can afford to store one bit of data in an incredibly tiny spot on the disk because it knows it will have the precision to address it exactly, safe from damage, dirt, and distortion, the DVD has to keep its bits of data in larger lumps so it can still be seen through your filthy fingerprints and coffee stains on your bent and scratched disk. It also keeps some parts of the disk to store checksum information to make up for those bits it still can't read.Continued technology improvements. When the DVD was invented it was considered impressively high-capacity. But it's limited by the requirement that discs be reproduced by physically molding plastic -- each ""bit"" of data is an actual pit in the plastic, detected by a laser shining on it.

How do American football have bruised lungs without also having broken ribs? Isn't that the point of ribs?,"This is actually one of the major issues with American football. The padding protects from the blunt hit and spreads out the impact so you aren't taking a lot of force to a particular place on your body, but your body is still being shoved really hard as a whole. This means the force is spread out and absorbed a bit so your skeleton isn't taking such a direct impact, but since a body at rest tends to stay at rest, when you get hit, your organs like to stay where they are as your skeleton is forced to move and they bang around inside their cage.Your ribs are fairly flexible, and that elasticity helps prevent the more serious injuries related to broken ribs . The ribs do protect the major organs in your rib cage, and without those ribs, those bruised lungs would have been far more severe. Bruised lungs are much less severe than broken ribs, so the elasticity helps to protect despite what you might think.",美式足球如何在沒有肋骨骨折的情況下瘀傷？那不是肋骨嗎？,這實際上是美式足球的主要問題之一。填充物可以免受鈍擊的侵害並散佈撞擊，因此您不會將大量的力量帶到身體上的特定位置，但是您的身體仍然整體上都被塞滿了。這意味著部隊散佈並吸收了一點骨骼被迫移動，它們在籠子裡撞擊。您的肋骨相當柔軟，這種彈性有助於防止與肋骨破裂有關的更嚴重的傷害。肋骨確實可以保護您的肋骨籠中的主要器官，而沒有這些肋骨，那些瘀傷的肺部將會更加嚴重。瘀傷的肺比肋骨骨折得多，因此儘管您可能會想到，彈性有助於保護。

How odds work if everything is random?,"Odds basically tell you that if the exact same situation were to occur an infinite number of times, what portion of those times would lead to that specific result. e.g. If you have the Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts and Jack of Hearts in your hand and 48 shuffled cards in front of you, there is a 1 in 48 chance you will end up with a 10 of hearts for a Royal Flush. There is no way of guessing which card will come up next, but if you shuffled that deck drew a card millions of times, you would get the Royal Flush 1/48 of the time. A pro would make that bet if it pays better than 48 times their money. They will only win 1/48 of the time, but if they get the chance to make that bet many many times in their lives, the rare win will make up for the cost of the lossesIf you roll a dice there is a 1/6 chance it will land on any of the given faces even though the act of rolling will produce a ""random"" result you can still predict that statistically being that it has 6 faces it should have an equal chance of dropping on the 1 vs the rest. The same goes for poker in that there are only so many possible card combos that you can calculate the chances of you getting a royal flush vs a Pair.",如果一切都是隨機的，那麼賠率是如何工作的？,賠率基本上告訴您，如果要發生的情況完全相同的次數，則這些次數中的哪一部分會導致該特定結果。例如如果您有心靈，心靈之王，心中的女王和心中的傑克，以及48張洗牌的卡片，那麼有48個機會中有1個機會，您最終將獲得10個心臟沖洗。沒有辦法猜測接下來會出現哪張卡，但是如果您趕上甲板的卡片數百萬次，您將獲得皇家沖洗時間的1/48。如果專業人士付出的錢比他們的48倍付出的賭注要好。他們只會贏得1/48的時間，但是如果他們有機會在生活中多次下注，那麼罕見的勝利將彌補損失的費用，如果您擲骰子，就會有1/6即使滾動的行為會產生“隨機”結果，它將降落在任何給定的面孔上，您仍然可以預測，從統計學上講，它具有6個面，它應該有相等的機會在1 vs ves其餘的情況下掉落。撲克也是如此，因為只有這麼多可能的卡組合可以計算出您獲得皇家沖洗與一對的機會。
how can i press my stomach out?,"The mechanism for inhaling is using your diaphragm to basically pull down, creating negative pressure in your lungs. When you inhale deeply to cause your abdomen to protrude, you relax your abdominal muscles and your diaphragm pushes down slightly on your abdominal organs, mostly your intestines, causing your abdomen to stick out.Edit: accuracy",我該如何壓肚子？,吸入的機制是使用隔膜基本上拉下來，在肺部產生負壓。當您深入吸氣以使腹部突出時，您的腹部肌肉放鬆，隔膜會稍微向下推動腹部器官，主要是腸子，使腹部伸出來。

The whole Wiki leaks and assange debacle.,"Assange made a website that exposed private and sensitive information about important people and events, in particular the government, and they got angry.Well it all started with Wikileaks. Wikileaks is simply a site where classified information is uploaded. Of course, this is not really anything new, News papers have done this for a long time . But Wikileaks manage to do this in a way big way. They have communication between diplomats, secret deals, and some disturbing shots of USA soldiers attacking civilians. The USA didn't like this on bit. They thought it was helping terrorists, and breaking the law . So they started thinking of ways of shutting it down. So the went to VISA, Mastercard and most other payment providers and said: don't give them any more money. So they closed all their accounts, and stopped all new donations. Wikileaks is fighting back, and have recently won a few court cases so they might soon get some money again. The other things is that the USA want Assange, as he started the whole thing. The problem is that he is in England. And England won't send anyone anywhere where they might risk life in jail or a death sentence. Which he might very well get in the USA. Around this time two ex-girlfriends of Assange surfaces in Sweden. They start talking about how Assange raped them, while they were in a relationship. Now, Sweden want Assange to try him for rape. Rape won't give him life in prison in Sweden, so England can send him there. Assange fears that he will be sent from Sweden to the USA. Which would be bad for him. One of the documents Wikileaks published was conversations between Sweden and USA, where USA basically ordered Sweden to shut down the piratebay.",整個Wiki洩漏和Assange崩潰。,阿桑奇（Assange）製作了一個網站，該網站暴露了有關重要人員和事件的私人和敏感信息，尤其是政府，他們生氣了。這一切都始於Wikileaks。WikiLeaks只是一個網站上載的網站。當然，這並不是什麼新事物，新聞報紙已經做了很長時間了。但是WikiLeaks設法以一種很大的方式做到這一點。他們在外交官，秘密交易和一些令人不安的美國士兵襲擊平民之間進行了交流。美國不喜歡這個。他們認為這正在幫助恐怖分子並違反法律。因此，他們開始思考關閉它的方法。因此，這些人去了Visa，MasterCard和大多數其他付款提供商，並說：不要再給他們任何錢。因此，他們關閉了所有帳戶，並停止了所有新捐款。Wikileaks正在反擊，最近贏得了一些法院案件，因此他們很快可能會再次獲得一些錢。另一件事是，當他開始整個過程時，美國想要阿桑奇。問題是他在英國。英格蘭將不會將任何人送往任何可能在監獄或死刑中生命的地方。他很可能會在美國得到。大約在這個時候，瑞典的兩個前女友。他們開始談論Assange在戀愛關係時如何強姦他們。現在，瑞典希望阿桑奇努力強姦他。強奸不會給他在瑞典的監獄中生命，因此英格蘭可以將他送到那裡。阿桑奇擔心他會被派往美國。這對他不利。Wikileaks發布的文件之一是瑞典和美國之間的對話，美國基本下令瑞典關閉Piratebay。

What ultimately stops you from jumping higher on a trampoline?,"Diminishing returns. The first time you jump on a trampoline, the only real force pushing you upward is coming from your legs. On the next bounce, the trampoline converts a bunch of your downward momentum into upward momentum and helps push you back up into the air. If you push off again with your legs as that's happening, you will go even higher than you did the first time. That means on the next bounce, you have even more downward momentum that the trampoline will convert into upward momentum for you . This works the first few times, but eventually you hit a point where you're already being pushed up into the air so quickly each time, your legs can't really do anything significant to help.",是什麼最終阻止您在蹦床上跳高？,收益遞減。第一次跳上蹦床時，將您向上推動的唯一真正的力量來自您的腿。在下一次彈跳中，蹦床將您的一堆向下動力轉換為向上動力，並有助於將您推向空中。如果您的腿再次推開，那您的腿會比第一次要高。這意味著在下一次彈跳中，您將擁有更大的下降動力，蹦床將為您轉化為向上的動力。這是最初幾次的工作，但是最終您每次都會如此迅速地將您的腿推向空中，您的腿實際上無法做任何重要的幫助。
What can I do as a single individual to get Gary Johnson in the debates?,"You could phone bank, donate to his campaign, that sort of thing. The question you should be asking yourself is why you want Gary Johnson in the debates. His economic policies are frankly terrible. He thinks that socialized medicine is a bad thing, when it's been proven to be the superior system in every measure except 5 year cancer survival rate.

(or 18): Indefinite Detention Act,"The portion everyone's worried about basically states that if someone is accused or suspected of being a terrorist the US government can detain them indefinitely regardless of whether or not they are an American citizen. This is a big deal because, in addition to reminding everyone of the Red Scare in the 50s, it is a direct violation of the bill of rights, specifically the fourth amendment. > Fourth Amendment – Protection from unreasonable search and seizure.The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. --Wikipedia Basically without a warrant, they cannot arrest you unless they see you committing the crime. This would remove that protection without modifying the constitution. In any sane environment it would immediately be thrown out by the Supreme Court as a violation of the constitution, but that its gotten this far to being passed is extremely worrying in and of itself. TL;DR: If the government doesn't like what you are saying/doing they can 'suspect' you of terrorism, or of planning terrorism, or having vague ties to terrorism, and detain you indefinitely behind bars. Or at least that's my understanding. Edit: Personally the distinction in the past few years that the constitution only protects American citizens and that for anyone else we can even ignore the Geneva convention if we feel like it is just as, if not more worrisome.

To make consumers feel better and buy more, some brands cheat a little bit on the size, so what is labelled as a size 6 is closer to a size 8.

What is happening after a workout in our body?,"As I understand itIn a workout with decent intensity your body releases testosterone and a pulse of growth hormone. After about an hour this pulse gives way to stress hormones like cortisol. During this time you deplete nutrients from the muscles, stress your bones, and usually slightly damage the muscle fibers. All these stimuli lead to your body adapting those systems to tolerate the strain you put on them. So in the days following the workout, your bones would get denser, muscles would be replenished and if you are eating in caloric excess OR you are a beginner, the muscles would grow slightly. I say caloric excess or beginner because at those times your body adapts very quickly to stresses. You will be incredibly sore, but as a novice you might be able to add 30 pounds to your maximum squat in 3 sessions. When just starting out, your body is panicking trying to adjust, so it pulls energy from your fat stores to supply the important tissues, the muscles Also soreness/physical pain is not a sign of an effective workout.",我們體內鍛煉後發生了什麼？,據我了解，這是一種體面強度的鍛煉，您的身體會釋放睾丸激素和生長激素的脈搏。大約一個小時後，該脈衝讓位於皮質醇等壓力激素。在此期間，您會從肌肉中耗盡營養，壓力骨骼，通常會稍微損壞肌肉纖維。所有這些刺激會導致您的身體適應這些系統以容忍您對它們的壓力。因此，在鍛煉後的幾天裡，您的骨骼會變得更密集，肌肉將得到補充，如果您的熱量過量飲食或者是初學者，則肌肉會略微生長。我說熱量過量或初學者，因為那時您的身體會很快適應壓力。您會感到非常痛苦，但是作為新手，您可能可以在3次會議中為您的最大蹲下30磅。當剛開始時，您的身體正在恐慌地試圖進行調整，因此它可以從脂肪儲存中吸取能量來提供重要的組織，肌肉也酸痛/身體疼痛也不是有效鍛煉的跡象。

what ever happened to Dane Cook?,"Credit to /u/noposters for this answer: What people don't realize about Dane Cook is that he was on a mega run before Harmful if Swallowed blew up. Even before his comedy central half hour, he was the highest paid comedian touring colleges at that time . Once his albums blew up, he played MSG, etc. he tried to make the transition into film. His films flopped, and simultaneously both his parents died and it was discovered that his brother/business manager had stolen 50million dollars from him . With all those things coming together, he took a bunch of time off. When he came back, tastes had changed and he no longer had the traction he'd had years earlier. He tried to make some comeback appearances but wound up generating controversy by trashing the audience at one of his shows at the Laugh Factory . Since then he's appeared here and there in LA and done some voiceover work, but for the most part he keeps a low profile. He's also alienated a lot of people in the NY comedy community for playing up his relationship with Patrice O'Neal in interviews when the two were, in fact, not close",丹恩·庫克（Dane Cook）發生了什麼事？,歸功於 /u /noposters這個答案：人們對丹恩·庫克（Dane Cook）沒有意識到的是，如果吞嚥吞嚥，他正處於有害之前的巨型奔跑。甚至在他的喜劇中央半小時之前，他還是當時收入最高的喜劇演員巡迴學院。一旦他的專輯炸毀，他演奏了MSG等。他試圖將其轉變為電影。他的電影失敗了，同時他的父母都去世了，發現他的兄弟/商業經理從他身上偷走了5000萬美元。隨著所有這些事情的融合，他休假了很多。當他回來時，口味發生了變化，他不再擁有幾年前的牽引力。他試圖捲土重來，但在他在笑工廠的一場演出中浪費觀眾來引起爭議。從那以後，他出現在洛杉磯這裡，做了一些配音工作，但在大多數情況下，他保持低調。他還疏遠了紐約喜劇社區中的許多人，因為他在面試中與帕特里斯·奧尼爾（Patrice O'Neal）建立了關係。

You will then reach an 'optimal' state of tiredness where you will probably be able to sleep within 30 mins. However, if you stay awake past this point your body thinks there is something wrong for you to still be awake, e.g. You're in danger. As a consequence and survival mechanism it gets rid of the drowsiness by releasing adrenaline to increase alertness as well as other mechanisms to make you alert.This state of temporary alertness can't be maintained for long and you still need to sleep eventually so you become tired again.The cycle can repeat but not for too long, maybe around a day or 2 at most.",為什麼疲勞感覺好像是波浪？,生物節律。您的身體有周期：呼吸，心跳，眨眼，甚至您使用的鼻孔。您的清醒/疲倦也是循環的。隨著您的身體越來越疲倦，您越來越難以讓您入睡。然後，您將達到“最佳”疲倦狀態，您可能可以在30分鐘內入睡。但是，如果您過後保持清醒，您的身體認為您仍然醒著有問題，例如你處於危險之中。結果和生存機制，它通過釋放腎上腺素來提高機敏性以及其他機制來使您保持警惕。再次累了。週期可能會重複但不會長時間，也許大約一天或兩天。
how does your brain produce a coloured image through staring at a negative?,"These are called afterimages and their existence is covered by something called Opponent Process Theory. Basically, you have 3 types of cells in your eye that detect color. They are called cones. One cone is sensitive to the wavelength of light we associate with ""red"", another to ""green"", and another to ""blue"" light. I put the color names in quotes because you must understand that COLOR DOES NOT EXIST IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD, YOUR BRAIN MAKES IT. This is itself is mindblowing but I promise it is true. Anyway, the cells get tired after looking at the same thing for too long . They are a bit like a rubber band that gets stretched out the more it sees a certain color, and the more it stretches the more it really really wants to snap back. Stretching makes you see one color , while snapping back makes you see another color . The deeper cells in your brain are arranged in 3 opponent pairs: red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. So, the more of you see of red, the more the opposite wants to come out. Same with the other colors. .Your eye sensors tire after a short while viewing a static image. In this example they're giving you a fixed point to focus on so that the image stays positioned in the same place on your retina. Notice how her lips are green in the negative. Staring at that wears our your green sensor there. Then, when you switch to look at white your eye's red sensors work but the green, temporarily, do not. So you see red lips.",您的大腦如何通過凝視陰性產生彩色圖像？,這些被稱為餘數，它們的存在被稱為對手過程理論的東西涵蓋。基本上，您的眼睛中有3種檢測顏色的細胞。它們被稱為錐。一種錐體對我們與“紅色”相關的光的波長敏感，另一個錐體對“綠色”，另一個對“藍色”光敏感。我將顏色名稱放在引號中，因為您必須理解外界不存在顏色，您的大腦就會做到這一點。這本身就是令人難以置信的，但我保證這是真的。無論如何，細胞在看相同的東西太久後會感到疲倦。它們有點像一個橡皮筋，它被伸出的顏色越多，它的伸展越多，它真正想要回去的越多。拉伸會讓您看到一種顏色，同時折回，使您看到另一種顏色。大腦中較深的細胞分為3對對手：紅綠色，藍黃色和黑白。因此，你們看到紅色的人越多，就越想出來。與其他顏色相同。一小段後，您的眼睛傳感器在查看靜態圖像時疲倦。在此示例中，他們為您提供了一個固定的關注點，以便圖像保持位於視網膜上同一位置。請注意，她的嘴唇在負面狀態下是如何綠色的。盯著那個穿著您的綠色傳感器。然後，當您切換以查看白色眼睛的紅色傳感器時，綠色暫時不行。所以你看到紅色的嘴唇。
"Why are most passwords hidden on-screen by default when you type them, but WIFI passwords are not?","Most on screen passwords are hidden in-case you have any shoulder surfers.

Of course, that's not always true - and for the times when it's no true, there's usually an option to hide the password on-screen.",為什麼大多數密碼在鍵入時默認屏幕上隱藏了屏幕，而WiFi密碼卻不是？,屏幕密碼上的大多數都是隱藏的，您都有任何肩膀衝浪者。WiFi密碼為您提供隱藏或顯示的選項，因為我認為WiFi密碼通常比其他帳戶密碼更長，因此很難確保您的鍵入而不看到它'在房間/地板/建築物/校園中，有密碼，下一個房間/地板/建築物/校園的人們不會。如果有人能夠在屏幕上看到密碼，顯然他們在同一房間/地板/建築物/校園，因此他們無論如何都應該擁有密碼。當然，這並不總是正確的 - 對於當時不是真的的時候，通常可以選擇在屏幕上隱藏密碼。
Why does time use the number 60?,"60 is easy to divide cleanly in multiple ways, and a number based on 60, such as the number of degrees in a circle, can be divided yet more ways. 60 can be divided by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 and itself. This provides many easy-to-reckon, useful fractions. In the days before pocket calculators, slide rules, Napier's Bones, etc. this made life simpler.",為什麼時間使用數字60？,"60易於以多種方式乾淨地分割，並且基於60的數字，例如圈子中的度數，可以劃分更多的方式。60可以除以1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30及其本身。這提供了許多易於排除，有用的部分。在口袋計算器，幻燈片規則，納皮爾的骨頭等之前的日子裡，這使生活變得更加簡單。"
Why does water taste bitter after eating pineapples?,"When the water hits your taste buds, they are stimulated a little. The problem is they have been overloaded with sugar and acid, thus they are temporarily unable to *report* sugar and acid at that moment. Therefore they report the only thing left: alkaline taste. Add that to the fact that most water has dissolved minerals in it that make it ever-so-slightly alkaline.",為什麼水吃菠蘿後味道苦？,當水撞到您的味蕾時，它們會受到刺激。問題是它們已經含有糖和酸，因此當時它們暫時無法報告 * *糖和酸。因此，他們報告了唯一剩下的東西：鹼性。再加上大多數水俱有溶解的礦物質的事實，使其成為鹼性的鹼性。
What does fuel stabilizer do to gasoline?,"Gasoline should keep indefinitely if stored properly. However, stabilisers can be useful if fuel is stored incorrectly, for example, in partially full tanks of small equipment. The larger tanks in modern cars are carefully designed to protect fuel from air and evaporation. Gasoline molecules can evaporate if the tank is not securely closed - a stabiliser won't do anything for that. Gasoline molecules can oxidise by exposure to oxygen - a fuel stabiliser can contain an anti-oxidant to absorb the oxygen, and neutralise the free radicals accelerate the oxidation reaction. Gasoline may contain traces of metal from manufacture/processing or from metal storage tanks. Certain metals can act as catalysts and cause the gasoline molecules to polymerise into sludge. Metal deactivator additives can absorb and neutralise the catalytic effect of metal contamination. Gasoline may contain large quantities of ethanol to meet biofuel targets by governments. If stored open to the air, the ethanol can absorb water from the air, and this can cause the water/ethanol mix to separate from the gasoline. By adding a different alcohol , the water/alcohol mix doesn't separate as easily. All these problems can be avoided if gasoline is stored in a tightly sealed plastic tank with only the minimum amount of air for an expansion space, as high quality gasolines will come with metal deactivators already added to neutralised contamination at the refinery.",燃料穩定劑對汽油有什麼作用？,如果正確存儲，汽油應無限期保留。但是，如果燃料的存儲不正確，例如，穩定器將在部分小型設備中儲存，將是有用的。現代汽車中較大的儲罐經過精心設計，以保護燃料免受空氣和蒸發的影響。如果油箱不牢固關閉，汽油分子可能會蒸發 - 穩定器不會為此做任何事情。汽油分子可以通過暴露於氧氣中氧化 - 燃料穩定劑可以含有抗氧化劑來吸收氧氣，併中和自由基加速氧化反應。汽油可能包含來自製造/加工或金屬儲罐的金屬痕跡。某些金屬可以充當催化劑，並導致汽油分子聚合成污泥。金屬取消活化添加劑可以吸收併中和金屬污染的催化作用。汽油可能包含大量乙醇，以實現政府的生物燃料靶標。如果將乙醇儲存在空氣中，則可以吸收空氣中的水，這會導致水/乙醇混合物與汽油分開。通過添加不同的酒精，水/酒精混合物不會很容易分離。如果汽油存儲在一個緊密密封的塑料罐中，只有最小的空氣用於擴展空間，則可以避免所有這些問題，因為高質量的汽油將與已經在煉油廠添加到中和污染的金屬停電器中。

Why do our eyes not see color on the edge of our peripheral vision?,"The cone cells that detect color aren't very good at low light or motion detection. Since motion detection is more important at the periphery than color we evolved to pack mostly rods and few cones in the corners. Your brain remembers what colors things are and will attempt to color in the peripheral vision so you don't usually notice that it's basically grayscale.We have two kinds of light receptors in our eyes: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to black and white; cones are more sensitive to colors and have a higher ability to focus. Cones are more concentrated in the centers of our eyes, while rods are more prevalent toward the edges of our eyes.",為什麼我們的眼睛在我們的外圍視力邊緣看不到顏色？,檢測顏色的錐細胞在低光或運動檢測方面不是很好。由於運動檢測在外圍比顏色更重要，因此我們演變為大部分桿和圓角很少的圓錐體。您的大腦記得什麼顏色是什麼，並且會嘗試在外圍視覺中染色，因此您通常不會注意到它基本上是灰度。我們的眼睛中有兩種輕受體：桿和錐體。桿對黑白更敏感。圓錐體對顏色更敏感，並且具有更高的聚焦能力。錐體更集中在我們眼中的中心，而桿更普遍地朝著我們眼睛的邊緣。
Why is it when I drink a glass of liquid I urinate at least twice as much back out?,"Your bladder only sends the ""time to pee"" message to your brain when it reaches a certain level of fullness.

There are some proteins like histones to which the DNA will almost always be attached. The histones kind of serve as a backbone for the DNA; a place for the DNA to organize itself.

why child support is based on income rather than what a child would need monthly.,"Child support is partially based on income. It is also partially based on the number of children and their age, the cost of basic living expenses and school in that general area, and whether or not any special needs are present. Which sometimes leads to a very high ratio, but that is also something that can happen when both parents live with their children; not all jobs pay a wage that covers a child's reasonable expenses. That doesn't mean those expenses don't occur though.",為什麼子女撫養基於收入，而不是兒童每月需要的東西。,兒童撫養部分基於收入。它也部分基於兒童的數量及其年齡，該一般地區的基本生活費用和學校的成本，以及是否存在任何特殊需求。有時會導致非常高的比例，但這也是父母都與孩子一起生活時可能發生的事情。並非所有工作都支付涵蓋孩子合理費用的工資。這並不意味著這些費用不會發生。

The different between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims.,"Shi'ites think that leadership in Islam should be hereditary, and that Imams more or less represent the authority of the founder through his bloodline. Sunnis think that leadership in Islam should be by some sort of democratic process, and you don't need to be a descendant of the founder to hold authority. It started out that way when the movement had to decide on how to continue after the death of its founder. Pretty soon, through in-fighting and because that is the way things go in a closely knit community, everybody and his uncle also had an opinion that would be forced upon the community. There is a Wikipedia article that goes into the various branches of islam in more detail: _URL_0_",遜尼派和什葉派穆斯林之間的區別。,什葉派認為，伊斯蘭領導的領導應該是世襲的，伊瑪目或多或少地代表了創始人的血統權威。遜尼派認為，伊斯蘭領導的領導應該是通過某種民主進程，而您無需成為創始人的後代才能擁有權威。當運動在其創始人去世後不得不決定如何繼續下去時，它開始了。很快，通過戰鬥，因為這是一個緊密編織的社區的事情，所以每個人和他的叔叔也都有一種被迫對社區的看法。有一篇Wikipedia文章更詳細地進入伊斯蘭的各個分支：_url_0_
Why did film become a synonym for movies when photography also used film?,"It depends on the context, but I'll stick to your examples. People didn't view still photographs on photographic film. They needed to be printed on photographic paper. Slides are an exception, but they didn't get popular until later. Motion picture film is negative and printed onto another piece of film to make a positive for viewing via a projector. Many people view magnified motion picture film, but most people never view still photo negatives. This is may not be the etymology, but it makes sense, and that's what your looking for.",當攝影也使用電影時，電影為什麼成為電影的同義詞？,這取決於上下文，但我會堅持您的示例。人們沒有在攝影電影中查看仍然的照片。它們需要印刷在攝影紙上。幻燈片是一個例外，但是直到後來它們才流行。電影膠片是負面的，並印在另一部電影上，以通過投影儀觀看陽性。許多人觀看了放大的電影膠片，但大多數人從未看過仍然否定的照片。這可能不是詞源，但這是有道理的，這就是您所尋找的。
The core beliefs of American political parties.,"This is a difficult question, America is insanely vast. A Republican in New York is going to be much different from a republican in Texas. A democrat in California will be different from a democrat in Michigan. Any person that wants to run for major office with a likable chance of winning usually has to run under one of these two parties, recent example: Bernie Sanders. The idea is Republican is generally more conservative, pushing for no economic regulation but social restrictions. Democrats are generally more Liberal pushing for zero social regulation but economic and business restrictions.Republicans: Man is the best decider for himself. Society will be much more efficient if it is every man to himself within reason. So the smaller the govt the better, the less control the govt has the more freedom individual man enjoys. The govt is only there to enforce laws so we dont go full anarchy. Republicans also believe in traditionalism; men should be men; women should be women, everyone has a fixed role in society. Democrats: The govt is the parent of its citizen children. As such govt needs to be big, and stuffed with taxes so it can take care of its citizens. No fixed societal roles, people can be whatever they want, do whatever they want . People's needs are fulfilled by govt back institutions; IE Dept of Education, Welfare Dept, Dept of Health, Dept of Security, etc.The simplest I could put it is: Democrats: Government should make adjustments to the distribution of wealth and services for the well-being of the majority. Republicans: Government should do only what is necessary to encourage a fair playing field so individuals can create their own well-being.",美國政黨的核心信念。,這是一個棘手的問題，美國是瘋狂的。紐約的共和黨人將與德克薩斯州的共和黨人大不相同。加利福尼亞的民主黨人將與密歇根州的民主黨人不同。任何想競選具有可愛機會的大型辦公室的人通常都必須在這兩個政黨之一的情況下進行競選，例如伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）。這個想法是共和黨人通常更保守，不採取任何經濟監管，而是社會限制。民主黨人通常會更自由地推動零社會監管，但經濟和商業限制。重視：人是自己最好的決定者。如果是在理性之內的每個人，社會將更加有效。因此，政府越小，政府的控制權就越越少。政府僅在那裡執行法律，因此我們不會完全無政府狀態。共和黨人也相信傳統主義。男人應該是男人；婦女應該是女性，每個人都在社會中起著固定的作用。民主黨人：政府是其公民子女的父母。因此，政府需要大大，並塞滿稅款，以便可以照顧公民。沒有固定的社會角色，人們可以做任何他們想做的事。政府退縮機構滿足人們的需求；IE教育部，福利部，衛生部，安全部等。我可以說的最簡單的是：民主黨：政府應調整財富和服務的分配，以供大多數人的福祉。共和黨人：政府只能做需要的事情來鼓勵公平的競爭環境，以便個人可以創造自己的福祉。

Why do real almonds not taste like almond paste/flavoring?,"The almond flavour you taste in almond paste, marzipan and so forth comes from an aromatic called benzaldehyde. This is found in *bitter* almonds, which also have a fairly hefty amount of cyanide; the latter is removed during the extraction of the benzaldehyde.

The compromises necessary to adapt to freezing temperatures cost in other areas so much that they are not evolutionary advantages. Cold, like flying, is something humans handle through their giant brains, social cooperation, and most excellent technology.

How can there be a sex wage gap in the US if we've had the Equal Pay Law since 1960?,"There's a bit of a misconception about the wage gap. For jobs in the exact same role with the exact same responsibilities, the wages are about the same. However, men tend to be more likely to be promoted to higher-paying positions. Women are also more likely than men to take extended time off or work part time while raising a family, meaning their careers are held back during that time.I read the reason women today get paid less isn't because of gender discrimination, it's because women are less likely to give up other benefits, such as vacation time, and they're more likely to accept or seek part time work instead of fulltime. But when you take those facts out and just look at numbers, you get ""women make less than their colleagues"" I don't know how true that is, but it sounds plausible to me.Isn't the wage gap mostly a myth? Most women tend to not take dangerous jobs and are more likely to work part time because they want to start families. I work at a hospital, the ceo is very highly paid woman and everyone is paid equally for same work. If this was really true you would see companies with a mostly female workforce and less payroll overhead. But as far as I know that doesn't really exist. Note: there are always exceptions to everything.",如果自1960年以來我們擁有同等薪酬法律，在美國如何才能存在性工資差距？,工資差距有些誤解。對於與完全相同的職責完全相同的工作，工資大致相同。但是，男性往往更有可能被晉升為高薪位置。女性也比男性更有可能在養育家庭時花費大時休息或兼職工作，這意味著她們的職業在那段時間裡被擱置了。我讀過今天女性獲得較少報酬的原因，不是因為性別歧視，這是因為婦女不太可能放棄其他福利，例如休假時間，而且她們更有可能接受或尋求兼職工作而不是全職工作。但是，當您將這些事實淘汰並看數字時，您會得到“女人的成績少於他們的同事”，我不知道這是多麼真實，但這聽起來對我來說是合理的。工資差距並不是神話嗎？大多數婦女往往不會從事危險的工作，並且更有可能兼職，因為她們想成立家庭。我在醫院工作，首席執行官是高薪的女性，每個人都在同一工作中獲得同等的報酬。如果這真的是真的，您會看到擁有大多數女性勞動力和更少薪資開銷的公司。但是據我所知，這並不存在。注意：一切總是有例外。

Why do American cities often have to take large public transport projects such as light rail and metro system to the voters but don't have to do the same for massive highway and road construction?,"Large road projects usually exist to keep the existing road network running, or to improve its relation to the rest of the city. Bridges need to be retrofitted, underpasses capped, tarmac replaced. They may be big projects, but they're really necessary to keep the system functioning like it is. A major public transportation network is an entirely new investment. If you don't do it, you don't it--there's no downside other than that you don't have the network. A comparable project would be the construction of an entirely new highway link , which is rare and nowadays often put to voters as well. Of note is that many major highway projects were initiated in a time when referendums for transportation were not as common.",為什麼美國城市經常必須將大型公共交通項目（例如輕軌和地鐵系統）帶到選民身上，而不必為巨大的高速公路和道路建設做同樣的事情？,通常存在大型道路項目，以保持現有的道路網絡運行，或者改善其與城市其他地區的關係。橋樑需要進行改裝，地下通道，停機坪更換。它們可能是大型項目，但確實必須像保持系統的功能一樣。主要的公共交通網絡是一項全新的投資。如果您不這樣做，那麼您不這樣做 - 除了您沒有網絡之外，沒有其他缺點。一個可比的項目將是建立一個全新的高速公路鏈接，這是罕見的，如今也經常向選民提供。值得注意的是，許多主要的高速公路項目是在交通全民公決並不那麼普遍的時候開始的。
How come bluetooth is so much slower than Wi-Fi?,"Bluetooth is designed to be short-range very low-power for small portable equipment. Part of the power-savings of Bluetooth come from diminished bandwidth . One could speed up Bluetooth to Wi-Fi speeds, but then it would defeat the purpose of BT's major design feature.

Why do we tear up when we yawn,"Not 100% sure if this is the correct answer, but the act of yawning presses against the glands which produce tears. These glands are like a sac, so pressing against these sacs make the tear flow regardless of if you need it or notI thought i were just weird. So to yawn, i would go to a private place and afterwards pinch myself to neutralize the urgeWhenever something on a film gets me to tear up I pretend to yawn for the benefit of other people in the room haTo yawn, a nerve impulse is triggered to all the muscles. It just so happens that the same nerves also affect the tear glands, triggering them simultaneously.I don't know, but you're a wizard casting magic onto me as I just yawned and for sure did tear up too.",為什麼我們打哈欠時我們會撕裂,不是100％確定這是否是正確的答案，但是打哈欠的行為會針對產生眼淚的腺體。這些腺體就像一個囊，因此不管您是否需要或noti認為我很奇怪，因此壓在這些囊上會使淚流流動。因此，打哈欠，我會去一個私人的地方，然後捏自己以中和，因為電影中的某些東西讓我撕裂了我假裝打哈欠的人，因為他在房間裡打哈欠的其他人，觸發了神經衝動，觸發了神經衝動所有的肌肉。碰巧的是，同樣的神經也會影響淚腺，同時觸發它們。我不知道，但是當我剛打哈欠時，您是一個嚮導向我施放魔法的，並且肯定也確實撕裂了。
"The new changes to paypal's policies, and why its bad for me.","The big one that's mentioned is the change that you can't join a class-action against paypal so I'll explain that. Lawsuits are expensive. Even a little suit against your neighbor over cutting down your tree can rack up costs from court fees and time spent arguing the case. In a major court case involving a huge business, this gets even worse with the added time and expense of hiring a lawyer. Generally speaking, a large corporation will have more money to throw at the court case than you do and can bog it down until you can't afford the costs anymore. Class action lawsuits are one of the defenses in the law against this. Instead of just representing yourself, you represent a whole group of people who were wronged by the corporation in the same way you were. EXAMPLE:Widget Works sells you a widget to trim your cat's fur. It sets the cat on fire and you sue for 200$ . Now, you can't afford to sue them and a lawyer won't do it for a cut of the reward. However, upon further research, you find that 10,000 other people had their cat set on fire by widgets. Although a cut of 200$ isn't enough for a lawyer, a cut of $2,000,000 is worth it. By filing a class action lawsuit of for yourself and those 10,000 people, you can actually find a lawyer to represent you.",貝寶政策的新變化，以及為什麼它對我不利。,"提到的最大的是，您無法加入針對PayPal的集體訴訟，所以我會解釋一下。訴訟很昂貴。即使是針對鄰居砍伐樹木的一小件衣服也可以從法庭費用和辯論此案花費的時間中提高費用。在涉及一項龐大業務的主要法院案件中，隨著僱用律師的增加時間和費用，情況變得更糟。一般而言，一家大公司將在法庭案件上投入的錢比您要多，並且可以陷入困境，直到您負擔不起費用為止。集體訴訟是法律中針對此事的辯護之一。您不僅僅是代表自己的人，他們以同樣的方式代表了一群被公司委屈的人。示例：小部件的工作賣給您一個小部件，以修剪貓的皮毛。它使貓著火了，您以200美元起訴。現在，您負擔不起起訴他們，律師不會為了削減獎勵而這樣做。但是，經過進一步的研究，您發現有10,000個人被小部件著火了。儘管對於律師來說，削減200美元是不夠的，但值得削減$ 2,000,000。通過為自己和10,000人提起集體訴訟，您實際上可以找到代表您的律師。"
Why do app developers like supercell release their updates/apps way earlier on one platform than the other?,"If you're referring to the time gap between Android and iOS releases, the answer is because of Apple. Things get on the Android market very easily and quickly, because the Android market is cool. Apple has dozens of excessive rules and guidelines that they strictly enforce, so they actually look through the app/code. This takes time, so they usually push the update to Android and iOS at the same time, and Apple takes forever to approve. edit: of course this doesn't mean that Android doesn't have or enforce guidelines. They just aren't ridiculous like Apple's.",為什麼像SuperCell這樣的應用程序開發人員會在一個平台上比另一個平台更早發布其更新/應用程序？,如果您指的是Android和iOS版本之間的時間差距，則答案是因為Apple。由於Android市場很酷，因此事情在Android市場上很容易，很快。蘋果公司嚴格執行了數十種過多的規則和準則，因此它們實際上瀏覽了應用程序/代碼。這需要時間，因此他們通常同時將更新推向Android和iOS，而Apple將永遠批准。編輯：當然，這並不意味著Android沒有或執行指南。他們只是不像蘋果那樣荒謬。

How do certain websites offer free copyrighted movies and television shows without being shut down?,"I know of a few websites that use servers that are outside of the US, specifically in regions in which they could give fuck-all about US Copyright laws. Think small eastern Euro countries, and the middle east. I personally met someone who ran an operation remotely in Saudi Arabia, from the US, and literally had $25k dropped into his bank account overnight after three or four months of successful operation. It's insanely lucrative if you know and understand basic webdev and some programming.",某些網站如何在不關閉的情況下提供免費的受版權保護的電影和電視節目？,"我知道一些使用美國以外的服務器的網站，特別是在他們可以為我們的版權法所付出的區域中。想想東部小歐元國家和中東。我個人遇到了一個從美國遠程在沙特阿拉伯遠程運營的人，實際上，在成功運營三到四個月後，一夜之間跌入了他的銀行帳戶25,000美元。如果您知道並了解基本的WebDev和一些編程，那將是非常有利可圖的。"
"The different branches of Christianity, and why they are no longer combated as heresy","In many Christian circles, this is the analogy that applies: Imagine a target, with three rings.

These people we 'd call heretics . In the next outer ring, the middle, we have ""secondaries"" - this contains issues like speaking in tongues, eating shellfish/pork, Saturday vs Sunday Sabbath, etc. We can disagree and have discussion on these, but it doesn't make you less Christian. In the outermost ring, everything else falls. This would be issues like watching R-rate movies, wearing jewelry made of gold, and non-related topics like playing sports or driving race cars. We use our secondaries and primaries to express our outermost issues. We have unity in primaries, liberty in secondaries, and charity in all.

Why does inbreeding cause the offspring to have a significantly lower IQ than average? What is the science behind it?,"take it that a human body has 2 sets of genes. When a baby is made, half the genes are from the mother and other half is from the father. These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases. Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically . If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformationsEveryone has a few bad genes. Luckily, we have two copies of each gene, and most of the time you need to bad ones to have a problem. When you have kids, both parents bring their bad genes to the table. Since they are likely to be *different* bad genes, their offspring likely won't have any problems. But when the parents are related, they are more likely to have the same bad genes, meaning the kids are more likely to get to copies. This can lead to a number of genetic disorders, including those that impact mental development. There is some confirmation bias in play, too. inbreeding is more likely to be noted when it results in a problem, and would go unnoticed otherwise. Also, having kids with a cousin, or even a sibling isn't that likely to be a problem. It takes multiple generations of inbreeding for genetic problems to become endemic. Societies where that happens tend to be remote and undeveloped. The people might seem ""stupid"" when they are merely different or less educated.",為什麼近親繁殖會導致後代的智商明顯低於平均水平？它背後的科學是什麼？,認為人體有兩組基因。當生一個嬰兒時，一半的基因來自母親，另一半來自父親。這些基因使蛋白質有助於我們的身體工作。但是，這些基因有時會出現一些錯誤，這些錯誤最終會導致缺陷/過多/太少蛋白質會導致疾病。其中一些疾病需要2個錯誤的基因才能表現出來。因此，如果爸爸的基因有缺陷，但媽媽貢獻了正常的組合，則該疾病在臨床上不會表現出來。如果有許多世代的近交，則將有缺陷的基因保留在同一家譜中。沒有來自不同家族的新遺傳輸入，因此有2組有缺陷基因的兒童增加的可能性增加。這增加了疾病的風險，其中有些人可能具有較低的智商/腦畸形分類劑具有一些不良基因。幸運的是，我們有每個基因的兩份副本，大多數時候您需要遇到問題。當您有孩子時，父母雙方都將他們的壞基因帶到桌子上。由於它們可能是 *不同的 *壞基因，因此他們的後代可能不會有任何問題。但是，當父母有關係時，他們更有可能擁有相同的壞基因，這意味著孩子更有可能獲得副本。這可能導致許多遺傳疾病，包括影響精神發展的疾病。遊戲中也有一些確認偏見。當近親繁殖引起問題時，更有可能被注意到，否則就不會引起人們的注意。另外，讓孩子有表弟，甚至是兄弟姐妹，這也不是一個問題。要成為流行的遺傳問題需要幾代人的近親繁殖。發生這種情況的社會往往是遙不可及的。當人們只是不同或受過少的教育時，他們可能看起來“愚蠢”。

"If we are 70% H2O, why are we considered Carbon based?","The chemistry that keeps us going is based on carbon-chain molecules. We do use water for some reactions but most of it is just solvent for molecules to float around and react in. It's somewhat like why we say tea is a plant-based beverage even though it's mostly water. The interesting part isn't the water.That would be kind of like calling a computer ""metal and fiberglass based"". The semiconductor chips that make a computer a computer are a small fraction of its total mass, but they are where the action is. Everything else is there to allow those chips to do their thing.",如果我們的H2O是70％，為什麼我們認為我們是基於碳的？,使我們繼續前進的化學反應是基於碳鏈分子。我們確實將水用於某些反應，但是大多數人只是溶劑，可以使分子漂浮和反應。這有點像為什麼我們說茶是一種基於植物的飲料，即使它主要是水。有趣的部分不是水，就像將計算機稱為“基於金屬和玻璃纖維”。使計算機成為計算機的半導體芯片是其總質量的一小部分，但它們是動作所在的地方。其他一切都可以讓這些籌碼做他們的事情。
Why do we have speed limits rather than a speed range?,"Because that's the top speed you can safely do, assuming ideal conditions . When it's raining, snowing, cold or dark, this changes it from being ideal conditions. It's not safe to drive at that speed any more. Worse it is, the slower you need to go, especially if your visibility is impaired. Too much variation in the weather to set a ""minimum speed"". Not sure about you are, but here there is a 5% tolerance on our 100kph speed limit - 105 before they'll ping you. The speed limit is the maximum allowable speed. [In areas that low speeds have been identified to be of particular hazard a minimum speed posting is made] This is not particularly common because it is rare that slower speeds present a significant risk to others if people maintain the rule of slower traffic keeping to the right .or the alternate rule enforced in some states of Left lane for passing only. In any case vehicles traveling far below the speed limit can be cited for impeding the flow of traffic even if a minimum speed sign is not posted.So the highway I commute on is regularly empty at night, and standard speed limits apply so it's a 55mph zone. During my commute I regularly come to a complete stop. So the speed range should be 0-55mph right? How is that any better than a speed limit? On smaller roads people regularly have to stop when making left turns to yield to oncoming traffic, that may require traffic behind them to stop, so zero mph needs to be legal on all streets.",為什麼我們有速度限製而不是速度範圍？,因為那是您可以安全地做到的最高速度，假設是理想的條件。當下雨，下雪，寒冷或黑暗時，這將從理想的條件中改變。以這種速度行駛不安全。更糟糕的是，您需要走的速度較慢，尤其是如果您的知名度受損。天氣的變化過多，無法設定“最低速度”。不確定您是，但是這裡的100kph速度限制對您有5％的公差-105，然後他們才能ping ping。速度限制是最大允許速度。[在已經確定的低速危險的區域中，提出了最低速度的張貼]這不是特別普遍，因為如果人們保持流量降低的規則，那麼速度較慢的速度很少會給他人帶來重大風險右。或在左車道的某些狀態下執行的替代規則僅通過通過。在任何情況下，即使沒有發布最低速度標誌，也可以引用遠低於速度限制的車輛，以阻礙交通流量。因此，我上下班的高速公路在晚上定期空蕩盪，標準速度限制適用於55mph區。在上下班期間，我經常停下來。因此，速度範圍應該為0-55mph吧？這比速度限制好嗎？在較小的道路上，人們經常在左轉彎以屈服於迎面而來的交通時必須停止，這可能需要在他們身後停止交通，因此在所有街道上都需要合法的MPH。
The world can't agree on standard units of measurement for anything except time. H ow come?,"They can and did. ISO standard units called the SI units.

But the part of the population with the most money to spend often doesn't fit within this group. Even if you do the latter, a well-crafted ad still can accomplish its purpose even if all it does is get a few seconds on YouTube before you kill it. It could show a specific symbol, sometimes not even a logo, such as the construction site and fast-talkin' he-man narrator that is associated with most ads for Ford trucks, or it could be a tiny snatch of ba-da-da-DA-daaah music, or the dancing coloured Apple silhouettes, or it could be some celebrity that you see later on the same full-version ad on TV where you don't skip it.

"Why is it that plants comparatively much less diverse (only ~250,000 species) than other clades of life?","I don't know for certain, but think about it: Plants are sedentary. They find a particular kind of environment that suits them well and, for the most part, stay in one place for their whole lives. They don't need to develop systems that allow for locomotion. They don't need to develop complex tissues and organs that make up that system, nor the vessels and oxygen transport mechanism to ensure the cells in the locomotion system stay energized. They don't require much energy since, again, they stay put; they make their own energy, and it's enough to get by on. Much of the complexity of animal life revolves around how they tweak the basic mechanics of moving around. Where does it move? How does it move? What does it require in order to move? How much and what kind of energy does it need? Does it regulate its own internal temperature?",為什麼植物比其他生命的其他進化枝少得多（只有約25萬種）？,我不確定，但是請考慮一下：植物久坐。他們找到了一種適合他們的特殊環境，並且在大多數情況下，一生都在一個地方留在一個地方。他們不需要開發允許運動的系統。他們不需要開發構成該系統的複雜組織和器官，也不需要使機能和氧氣轉運機制確保運動系統中的細胞保持通電。他們不需要太多能量，因為他們再次保持原樣。他們創造自己的能量，足以實現。動物生命的許多複雜性圍繞著它們如何調整四處走動的基本機制。它在哪裡移動？它如何移動？為了移動需要什麼？它需要多少能量？它會調節自己的內部溫度嗎？

"Are mobile ads intentionally the last thing to load while opening a page, so more people would accidentally click them?","No. Ads are usually provided by a 3rd party company from their servers, not the same server that is delivering the rest of the content on the page, so they can often take longer to load compared to other stuff on the page. They are often also image-heavy, which means they take longer to load than text. They are also usually inserted into the page using javascript, so that they can load several different ads to different viewers on the same page, or target ads to different users, or track impressions, & c. The script that loads these ads often runs after other content in the page has loaded, so that the page doesn't have to wait on the ads & just display as blank while the ads load .",移動廣告是故意在打開頁面時加載的最後一件事，因此更多的人會意外單擊它們？,否。廣告通常是由他們的服務器的第三方公司提供的，而不是與頁面上交付其餘內容的服務器相同，因此與頁面上的其他內容相比，它們通常可以花費更長的時間來加載。它們通常也很重，這意味著它們的加載時間比文本要長。通常還使用JavaScript將它們插入頁面中，以便它們可以在同一頁面上的不同觀眾中加載幾個不同的廣告，或者將廣告定位為不同的用戶，或跟踪印像等。加載這些廣告的腳本通常在頁面中的其他內容加載後運行，因此頁面不必在廣告上等待，而只是在ADS加載時顯示為空白。

why are there no comedy categories at the Oscars,"Each awards show has their own thing. You're probably aware of the Oscars and the Emmy, but there are like a hundred others with their own style and categories. However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas , but this is still pretty new. They changed the voting on it a bit too, but its unknown if this had any effect on the eventual winners.

Why are smoke shops allowed to sell bongs?,"Next time you go there, look for a sign. There will be one saying ""For Tobacco Use Only"" While bongs are commonly associated with marijuana, they are also used for tobacco and in that regard are perfectly legal. By saying they're only for tobacco it protects the stores from the drug laws you mention. So in order for there to be any legal consequences, people would have to prove that the shop is knowingly selling them for use with marijuana and not tobacco. This is impossible to prove in almost every case.",為什麼允許煙店賣菸槍？,下次您去那裡時，尋找一個標誌。將有一個說“僅用煙草使用”的說法，而煙槍通常與大麻相關，但它們也用於菸草，在這方面是完全合法的。通過說它們僅用於菸草，它可以保護商店免受您提到的毒品法律的侵害。因此，為了產生任何法律後果，人們將不得不證明該商店有意將其出售給大麻，而不是煙草。在幾乎每種情況下，這都是不可能證明的。
How does hot water work in hotels?,"While all buildings are a little different, most use a single boiler and a recirculating hot water system. Hot water circulates in big loops on each floor, driven by small magnetic pumps. This means the water is ""instant-on"". The storage tank is kept warm by the boiler and inflowing water is warmed before it goes into the tank. This provides constant temperature hot water all dayMany hotels and large buildings have a boiler system for hot water. Larger buildings would probably have multiple systems that cover a zone. It would simply be a maintenance nightmare to have individual hot water heaters in each room.",熱水如何在酒店工作？,雖然所有建築物都有些不同，但大多數建築物都使用單個鍋爐和循環熱水系統。熱水在每個樓層的大環中循環，由小型磁泵驅動。這意味著水是“即時的”。儲罐通過鍋爐保持溫暖，並在進入水箱之前將其流動加熱。這提供了整天的恆溫熱水，大型建築物具有用於熱水的鍋爐系統。較大的建築物可能具有多個覆蓋區域的系統。每個房間裡都有單獨的熱水熱水器只是一場維護噩夢。

How come Humans can't learn animal languages and communicate to them?,"Because animals don't have language. They communicate emotions with sound like angry growls, panicked screams, horny rumbles, and affectionate purrs, but they can't communicate abstract thoughts, form sentences, assign arbitrary names to objects and events, combine terms to make new concepts, etc, which is what we consider language to be. A Mandarin-speaker and a Finnish-speaker can communicate anger and fear and happiness and affection perfectly well without using language, right? Just by sounds, tones, movements, facial expressions? Well, that's the level on which animals communicate.",人類為什麼無法學習動物語言並與他們交流？,因為動物沒有語言。他們用聲音傳達情緒，就像憤怒的咆哮，驚慌的尖叫聲，角質隆隆聲和親切的purr刺，但他們無法交流抽象的思想，形成句子，將任意名稱分配給對象和事件，結合術語來製作新概念，等等我們認為語言是什麼。講普通話的人和芬蘭語者可以很好地傳達憤怒，恐懼，幸福和感情，而無需使用語言，對嗎？僅憑聲音，音調，動作，面部表情？好吧，這就是動物交流的水平。
What do degrees (temperature) actually measure?,"At a basic level you can think of temperature as the average molecular energy of a system. Temperature can be measured in different ways, but they all come down to measuring changes in heat energy . In everyday thermometers, what is measured is how a liquid expands with temperature, travelling up the bulb. The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder. In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely. There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off. It's important to note that temperature isn't the same thing as energy, but the explanation requires delving into the wonders of thermodynamics, which is a bit too complicated for me to ELI5.",學位（溫度）實際測量什麼？,在基本水平上，您可以將溫度視為系統的平均分子能。溫度可以以不同的方式測量，但它們都歸結為測量熱能的變化。在日常溫度計中，測得的是液體如何隨溫度膨脹，向上行駛。膨脹是由於液體中的原子移動速度更快，並且彼此越來越難。在稱為熱電偶的設備中，溫度會影響一件金屬的傳導能力，這可以精確測量。還有紅外溫度計，它們以物體散發的光的形式測量熱能。重要的是要注意，溫度與能量不同，但是解釋需要深入研究熱力學的奇觀，這對我來說對ELI5來說太複雜了。

Why is it such a big deal that it costs more than 1 cent to make a penny?

You could say ""sure, I throw away every other roll of toilet paper I buy without using it, but I buy toilet paper at half price."" Well, it would be better still to buy that half-price toilet paper and NOT throw any away. There are a lot of other good reasons to get rid of pennies, but I won't bore you by going into them here.It's not really a deficit. A coin isn't money, it's the representation of money.

Why aren't any famous people getting assassinated?,"In terms of political figures like the president, the Secret Service has gotten really good at spotting that sort of behavior, and stopping potential threats long before it's a take a bullet type situation. Not saying it couldn't happen, but it's not usually something an average Joe would do out of the blue without warning, it's pretty much always radicals who are being watched. In terms of celebs usually it's a crazy stalker who sends all sorts of e-mails and letters and tweets and whatever, so the private security of celebs know who they're looking for and they get tipped off if some nut job is driving across 12 states to where the celeb they're stalking is preforming a concert and they don't even have tickets. Still easier than the president but also less people care/are crazy enough to do it. I mean you've got to be crazy to kill the president but at least you can make sense of it like with Booth killing Lincoln. He legitimately believed Lincoln was a tyrant and he was a patriot doing the noble and riotous thing. Compare that to that nutcase who killed John Lennon. I mean NOTHING makes scene about that other than he was just some crazy fuck. No real driving motivation like there is with politics. We also have a lot more medications available for people and a much more effective system of spotting crazies in our society and getting them the necessary treatment.Given the secret service deploy trained counter-snipers who map out every possible hide in a speech location beforehand and then watch those positions?

Why are speed caps used by ISP's and how do they work?,"CFAggie isn't really right, that was the case before fiber internet and massive technological feats. I was once studying to be a network engineer, and I picked a few things up. They do it because they're greedy assholes. I know that's doom-and-gloom to the point of being laughable, but that's why. American and most European internet is very developed and chances are only a minuscule percentage of their servers are being used at any given time. Take a look at the places Google Fiber has rolled in, best example being right where I live. The same day Google Fiber was *announced* our speeds went up from 5/1 for $50 a month to 300/200 for $50 a month. The internet here no longer goes out randomly, throttles, or has any other issue. Internet companies will ""buy out"" areas so other internet service providers can't lay down wire and the only ISP in that area can keep speeds and reliability in the shitter for sky-high prices. It's just a regressive business practice. Paying more for the same technology.",為什麼ISP使用的速度蓋？它們如何工作？,Cfaggie並不是真的，在纖維互聯網和大量技術壯舉之前就是這樣。我曾經在學習成為一名網絡工程師，我挑選了一些東西。他們這樣做是因為他們是貪婪的混蛋。我知道這是可笑的厄運和糖，但這就是原因。在任何給定時間，美國和大多數歐洲互聯網都非常發達，很可能僅使用其服務器的一定百分比。看看Google纖維已經滾動的地方，最好的例子就是我居住的地方。*宣布Google纖維的同一天 *我們的速度從5/1售價為每月50美元，每月50美元。這裡的互聯網不再隨機出現，油門或存在任何其他問題。互聯網公司將“購買”區域，以便其他互聯網服務提供商不能鋪設電線，並且該區域中唯一的ISP可以在高價價格上保持速度和可靠性。這只是一種回歸的商業實踐。為同一技術支付更多費用。
the oligodynamic effect (i.e brass doorknobs disinfecting themselves after a period of time),"The effect is certainly pretty cool. Essentially what is described is that frequently touched materials can gather lots of microorganisms really easily, just because they're found literally everywhere at extremely high levels. When you touch a doorknob, you transfer the bacteria on your hand to the doorknob. However, the nature of the brass is such that it interferes with the functioning of the bacteria or fungus etc. resulting in the death of the microorganism. It is suspected that the metal interferes with the correct functioning of proteins needed for the survival of these bugs. Also, an interesting thing to note is that you reference ""disinfecting"" in your initial question. There is a difference between disinfection and sterilisation; disinfection means that the most harmful microorganisms are killed, but not their spores. This means that there is potential for their survival, for example if they were transferred back to someone's hand from the doorknob. Sterilisation is complete removal of harmful and harmless bacteria and there spores, which is different. Long winded explanation, I hope that this helps out a little!', ""It's a fancy name for a simple concept. Atoms of heavy metals interfere with certain enzymes and proteins -- molecules that cells need to live.

"Air pressure in houses? Why do some doors hit a cushion of air when they close, some doors slam when they close, and some doors get sucked closed?",It's depends on how air tight the room is.

Take a door that you can't slam because of this and open a window in that room the air will be forced out the window and the door will close easier.

Theres also this sense in Japan of following the order of things just for the sake of the law. A lot of westerners will do things they know they aren't supposed to, if they think they can get away with it. Japanese I think are more likely to take the ""safe"" road. Lots of generalizations here, but I think it mostly holds true.",為什麼日本的粉絲內容創作者對他們的活動更嚴格以避免版權問題，而不是西方粉絲創建者？,社會責任感。一般而言，對於原始創作者，日本文化具有更大的道德意識。他們不想傷害創作者。在日本，僅出於法律而遵循事物的順序也是如此。如果他們認為自己可以擺脫困境，許多西方人會做他們不應該做的事情。我認為日本人更有可能走“安全”的道路。這裡有很多概括，但我認為這主要是正確的。
The difference between a parody and a satire,"Parody is imitation. Satire is humorous, constructive, social criticismYou are a politician who does lots of work on food standards and safety. A parody show is made about you, featuring a politician who looks a lot like you with exaggerated features, and spends most of his time ranting about burgers being dangerous whilst getting nothing done. A running joke is a policy he makes, that is almost identical to that one you made, but it's deliberately made stupider and sillier than your real policy. A satire show is made about \'you,\' featuring a cast of characters in a government department going through various situations that explore, make light of, and highlight issues with food standards and safety, sometimes taking jabs at policies similar in spirit to ones you 've tried to enact in order to highlight the flaws in the policy to the viewer, other times making the audience think ""huh, it really is worrying that they get hamburger meat from such sources.""",模仿和諷刺之間的區別,模仿是模仿。諷刺是幽默，建設性的社會批評，您是一位政治家，他在食品標準和安全方面做很多工作。關於您的模仿節目，有一個看上去很像您的政治家，並以誇張的功能花費了大部分時間，他大部分時間都在忙於漢堡危險，而什麼都沒做。一個笑話是他制定的政策，這與您制定的政策幾乎相同，但它故意使愚蠢而愚蠢，比您的真正政策更加愚蠢。關於\'you，\'的諷刺表演，特徵是政府部門中的一群角色，經歷了各種情況，這些情況探索，闡明並突出了食品標準和安全的問題，有時會在精神上與類似的政策進行戳戳，您試圖制定的人是為了強調觀眾的政策中的缺陷，其他時候讓觀眾認為“嗯，真的很擔心他們從這種來源那裡得到漢堡包。”
"How come—when looking at the light produced on earth VIA satellite imagery, they are always yellow, when in fact, there are lights of all different colors being produced?","It's not VIA, it's just via, a word. :-) Anyhow, the answer is simple: most electric lights are actually yellow, so when you look at a lot of lights grouped together from far away, you see mostly yellow light.",當通過衛星圖像查看地球上產生的光線時，它們總是是黃色的，而實際上，它們總是會產生所有不同顏色的光？,它不是通過，只是通過一個字。:-)無論如何，答案很簡單：大多數電燈實際上都是黃色的，因此，當您從遠處匯集在一起的許多燈光時，您會看到大部分黃色的光線。
"Why is insurance handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government?","> and that's definitely not who I would want backing me if I get in an accident. except that, unless you were criminally stupid when signing a contract, in this particular case you get to sue them, i.e. get the government involved. Under capitalism, the government is the policeman, not the entire economy.That depends which country you are in. For my country, Canada, for health insurance it is handled by government. For car insurance it is mandated by government law that you buy private non-government insuranceWhat you are describing is basically how insurance is handled in most first world countries in the world. The USA is pretty much the only country in what we usually consider the ""western world"" that has no universal/socialized healthcare. Why is it like that? Well that's a complicated issue. Lobbyists and propaganda have a lot to do with it. The large insurance companies in the US have the government by its balls and aren't ever going to let something like universal healthcare happen. In order to keep the masses believing that this is best they like to spread nonsense propaganda like ""It's communist and communists are scary!"" or ""Do you want some government bureaucrat decide which meds you should get?""', ""Look how unemployment insurance is handled. You pay into it and they make you fight for it when you need it and then pretend like you're asking for a hand out when it's literally your own money.",為什麼保險是由私人，營利性公司而不是政府處理的？,>如果我發生事故，那絕對不是我想要支持我的人。除此之外，除非您在簽訂合同時犯有刑事愚蠢的態度，否則在這種情況下，您可以起訴他們，即讓政府參與其中。在資本主義下，政府是警察，而不是整個經濟。對於汽車保險，政府法律要求您購買您所描述的私人非政府保險，這基本上是如何在世界上大多數第一世界國家處理保險。美國幾乎是我們通常認為沒有普遍/社會化醫療保健的“西方世界”中唯一的國家。為什麼那樣？好吧，這是一個複雜的問題。遊說者和宣傳與它有很大關係。美國的大型保險公司擁有政府的球，永遠不會讓像普遍醫療保健這樣的事情發生。為了讓群眾相信這是最好的，他們喜歡傳播胡說八道的宣傳，例如“共產黨和共產主義者令人恐懼！”或“您是否希望一些政府官僚決定您應該得到哪種藥物？”，“看一下如何處理失業保險。當這實際上是您自己的錢時，請伸出援手。
How do tunnel builders know where they are going?,"i dont know anything about that specific project, but in general there is an engineer that surveys in the centerline of the tunnel using a theodolite . you basically move a known point down the tunnel using the previous point along the centerline as a reference. you offset each point from the actual centerline so that you can mark the actual points with a nail along the tunnel wall, out of the way._URL_1_ This is episode one of a three part fly on the wall documentary called 'The Fifteen Billion Pound Railway' about the current construction of a new underground railway line underneath London.

Episodes 2 and 3 are also very good, all on youtube.",隧道製造商如何知道他們要去哪裡？,我對該特定項目一無所知，但總的來說，有一個工程師使用理想者在隧道的中心線進行調查。您基本上使用沿中心線的上點作為參考，將已知點沿隧道移動。您將每個點從實際的中心線中偏移，以便您可以用隧道牆壁釘標記實際點。'關於目前在倫敦下面的新地下鐵路線的建設。尤其有趣的是“針的眼睛”部分，因此，新隧道只需與附近現有隧道的80厘米間隙無聊。第2集和第3集也非常好，全部在YouTube上。
How exactly do Saline pools work?,"Salt water pools still use chlorine, the difference is that the chlorine is produced through electrolysis using the salt as the base material. The advantage is that the salt electrolysis process creates free chlorine ions and burns off chloramines . As long as they are maintained they will work just as well at killing bacteria, and people tend to find them less irritating, especially if they have sensitive skin. The salt system also has the benefit of ""softening"" the water. They tend to have a higher initial setup cost though, and saltwater is more corrosive than freshwater so you have to keep an eye on the internals and plumbing of the filtration systemSalt water pools are also much more damaging to local eco systems, if drained improperly they will destroy vegetation and if sent down storm drains they will wreck havoc on water treatment systems. This why many municipalities want to ban them.",鹽水池究竟如何工作？,鹽水池仍然使用氯，其不同是氯是通過用鹽作為基本材料的電解產生的。優勢在於鹽電解過程會產生游離的氯離子並燃燒氯胺。只要維持它們，它們就會在殺死細菌方面同樣努力，人們傾向於發現它們的刺激性較小，尤其是在皮膚敏感的情況下。鹽系統還具有“軟化”水的好處。他們往往具有更高的初始設置成本，而鹽水比淡水更具腐蝕性，因此您必須關注過濾系統的內部設備和管道，也會對當地的生態系統造成更大的破壞，如果不正確地耗盡了它們將摧毀植被，如果將雨水淹沒，他們將對水處理系統造成破壞。這是為什麼許多市政當局想禁止他們的原因。
"Why did I just pay $250 for a passport with a 3-week turnaround, when a driver's license is $25 and take 30 minutes?","A driver's license is a state-issued document accepted by state governments certifying your identity and ability to drive. A passport is a federally-issued document accepted by international governments certifying your identity and travel eligibility and history. Whereas you can get away with a temporary driver's license printed on a DMV receipt printer, a passport has a LOT of liability tied to it and basically is your country insuring you as ""This person is a Normal Person"" The cost comes from the legal backing, as well as whatever background checks they need to run on you', ""The process it goes through is why it takes so long normally to get it.

Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights?,"> Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights? Aircraft commonly land at night when it is dark. Being able to see the ground when coming in for a landing is important because they need to touch down at a reasonable speed. So not to put too fine a point on it, they are so the pilots can see when it is dark. You know, like with regular car headlights.So they can see what's ahead. The lights shine on the runway, making it brighter and easier to see during both take-off and landing.

"How if I have some software that requires a product key that you must pay for, that many people can use the same key?","There are two ways that a product key can be validated. The first way is that the program ""phones home"" to check that the key is valid, and is tied to your account. This type of validation means that the same key can only be used once. But the other way that a key can be validated is if there is some algorithm that generates valid keys, and that can verify that a particular key is valid. For example, maybe keys are generated by taking your email address, appending some fixed string of letters to the end , and then feeding the resulting string through a hashing algorithm . The resulting hash is your product key. In this case, it's super easy for the program to verify that a given email address + product key is valid, because it just takes the email, appends the secret string to it, and then hashes that to see if the resulting hash equals the product key you entered. This has the advantage of not requiring an Internet connection to activate the software, but does make it vulnerable to re-used keys. I 've seen some companies that make the credit card number used to purchase the product part of this process to discourage sharing of product keys .",如果我有一些需要您必須支付的產品密鑰的軟件，那麼許多人可以使用相同的密鑰？,可以通過兩種方式驗證產品密鑰。第一種方法是程序“手機家”以檢查鍵是否有效，並與您的帳戶綁定。這種類型的驗證意味著相同的密鑰只能使用一次。但是，可以驗證鍵的另一種方式是，如果有一些生成有效密鑰的算法，並且可以驗證特定鍵是否有效。例如，也許通過獲取電子郵件地址，將一些固定的字母串到末端生成，然後通過哈希算法將所得的字符串饋送。由此產生的哈希是您的產品密鑰。在這種情況下，該程序非常容易驗證給定的電子郵件地址 +產品密鑰是否有效，因為它只是採用電子郵件，將秘密字符串附加到它，然後hashhes查看結果是否等於產品您輸入的鍵。這具有不需要Internet連接來激活軟件的優點，但確實使其容易受到重複使用的密鑰的影響。我看到一些公司將信用卡號用於購買此過程的產品部分，以阻止產品鑰匙的共享。
How does a contagion spread from contact with an open wound to the target organ in the body ?,"Generally through the blood stream or the lymphatic vessels. When a contagion attacks a specific organ I.e. Hepatitis, it is because something about those cells allows that particular pathogen to attack/reproduce better than they do in other cells. They don’t move towards that organ specifically, they just keep getting pumped through the bloodstream until they find a good place to start reproducing, or they’re killed by the immune system",傳染性如何從與體內靶器官的開放傷口接觸中傳播？,通常通過血流或淋巴管。當傳染攻擊特定器官時，即肝炎，這是因為有關這些細胞的某些東西使特定病原體可以比其他細胞更好地攻擊/再現。他們並沒有具體地朝那個器官邁進，他們只是不斷地通過血液抽水，直到找到一個開始繁殖的好地方，否則它們被免疫系統殺死
How does a state minimum wage increase impact people?,"Essentially minimum wage increases due to inflation, inflation is the concept that money isn't worth as much as it used to, and therefore you need more of it But what happens is that the cost of everything increases, but the amount of money people have stays the same, meaning that to maintain their standard of living, they need to increase their wage. But of course, this means people now have more money, and people will be willing to raise their prices accordingly, causing inflation causing the circle to go round. It's what happens when you have a currency that is arbitrary, in the sense that it isn't tied to anything solid, like a resource, ie Gold Standard.",州的最低工資如何增加對人們的影響？,本質上是由於通貨膨脹而增加的最低工資，通貨膨脹是一種概念，即金錢不如以前的價值，因此您需要更多的資金保持不變，這意味著要維持自己的生活水平，他們需要提高工資。但是，當然，這意味著人們現在有更多的錢，人們將願意相應地提高價格，從而導致通貨膨脹導致圈子轉彎。這就是當您擁有任意貨幣時，就會發生這種情況，從某種意義上說，它與任何可靠的東西（例如資源，即黃金標準）息息相關。
Why do trained muscles get more volume rather than density?,"Skeletal muscles are the muscles that you use for voluntary movement like your arms, legs, etc. They're made of myocytes, which have a limited ability to divide. Other cells in your body constantly divide, like your skin or the inside of your mouth . When a cell is stressed out, as in it receives stress from either hormones, exercise or something rubbing up against it, etc, it'll adapt in order to take more stress. Your muscles can't divide, so they undergo hypertrophy or get bigger. Your skin cells divide more to compensate but they also secrete more keratin. Why do they have a limited ability to divide? It just comes down to the fact that they're highly specialised. Generally, the less specialised the cell is, the more it can divide. Stem cells, or pluripotent cells are not specialised at all, but they can divide endlessly and become any cell in the body. Myocytes, cardiomyocytes , and neurons are highly specialised cells and have very poor ability to divide. it's why heart attacks are so bad, and why spinal damage doesn't heal properly.",為什麼訓練有素的肌肉會獲得更多的體積而不是密度？,骨骼肌是您用於自願運動（例如手臂，腿等）的肌肉。它們是由肌細胞製成的，它們的分裂能力有限。您體內的其他細胞不斷分裂，例如皮膚或口腔內部。當一個細胞壓力出現時，因為它會從激素，運動或對其摩擦等的東西受到壓力，它將適應以承受更多的壓力。您的肌肉無法分裂，因此他們會經歷肥大或變大。您的皮膚細胞分裂以補償，但它們還會分泌更多角蛋白。為什麼他們分裂的能力有限？這只是歸結為他們非常專業的事實。通常，該單元的專業越少，它可以分裂的越多。幹細胞或多能細胞根本不專門，但是它們可以無休止地分裂並成為體內的任何細胞。心肌細胞，心肌細胞和神經元是高度專業的細胞，分裂的能力很差。這就是為什麼心髒病發作如此糟糕的原因，以及為什麼脊柱損傷無法正常癒合的原因。

When I put pressure on my eyes for an extended period of time I see really cool patterns that alternate. What is that?,"your eye is full of liquid called the vitreous humour. when you press on your eyes, you're increasing the pressure of that fluid inside the eye; that in turn causes pressure to be applied to the nerves in the back of your eye, on your retina. those nerves get confused and start sending out random signals that you see as cool-ass patterns.I LITERALLY just read about this is my anatomy and physiology textbook 10 minutes ago Basically, the colors you are seeing are false stimuluses that are generated on labeled lines, or the links between your pressure receptors in your eyelids and the part of the brain that is deciphering those stimuliSome archaeologists/anthropologists believe that these images may be the inspiration for geometric cave art.The patterns you see when you press on your eyes is because your eyes are sensitive to physical pressure, just like the nerves in the rest of your body, only your brain interprets their signals as light instead of touch.

"Do uncontacted tribes know we're here, like we are aware of their presence?","My impression is that most of them are aware that some kind of big, huge, technologically advanced world exists, but they don't know shit about it.

Its like saying that washing your chest with a bar of soap should alleviate a chest coldAn antiseptic kills bacteria. But a sore throat is often caused by a viral infection. A virus strongly differs from bacteria, since it is in principle only a piece of DNA and not a living organism like a bacterium. It uses cells as a host to reproduce itself. It would be necessary to use antivaral drugs to stop them. The reason why they are not common to be used if you have a sore throat is probably strong side effects and to avoid new drug resistant viruses.",為什麼我們不能只是牙齒吞噬喉嚨痛？,因為喉嚨痛的根源不是躺在喉嚨表面，而是在周圍的軟組織中。就像說用肥皂棒洗胸部應該減輕雞coldan殺菌劑會殺死細菌。但是喉嚨痛通常是由病毒感染引起的。病毒與細菌有很大不同，因為它原則上僅是一塊DNA，而不是像細菌一樣活的生物體。它使用細胞作為宿主來複製自身。有必要使用抗生素藥物阻止它們。如果您的喉嚨痛酸痛可能是不常見的原因可能是強烈的副作用並避免抗藥性病毒。
"With the recent ""Infinity Table"" posts, can someone explain how they work?","First, let's explain what a ""one-way mirror"" is: It is not a mirror that only reflects light going in one direction. It is a _partially reflective mirror_ that allows some light of either direction to go through, and reflect some light of either direction. What this means in practice is that depending on relative lighting conditions, it may appear to be a window or a mirror. An example of this would be your house window - on a bright sunny day, you have no trouble looking out. Someone outside, however, may see a reflection. This is because the glass reflects some light, and transmits others. Since the outside is _so_ bright, a large amount of light is reflected back to the observer outside. This overwhelms any light that is transmitted from inside to outside. The indoor observer, on the other hand, as a lot of light transmitted _into_ the window, so any reflected light is drowned out by the transmitted light. You will notice the reverse at night, when you have lights turned on and outside is dark. Now the indoor observer will see a lot of reflection, and the outside observer has no trouble peering in. Alright, so knowing this now, how does the infinity table work? The bright lights within the table makes the inside bright. Some light gets leaked out to your eyes - that's what you see. Other light gets reflected to the bottom mirror, which gets reflected back. Some of _that_ light reaches your eye, but another fraction gets reflected back to the bottom mirror, and so forth. That's why you see many copies - and that's also the reason each reflection gets dimmer and dimmer - some light escapes, and other is absorbed. Only a fraction is reflected each time. It has nothing to do with projected images.",有了最近的“無限桌”帖子，有人可以解釋他們的工作方式嗎？,首先，讓我們解釋一下“單向鏡子”是什麼：它不是只反映在一個方向上的光線的鏡子。這是一個_始終反射式的鏡像，可以使任一方向的一定光線通過，並反射任何方向的光線。實際上，這意味著根據相對照明條件，它似乎是窗戶或鏡子。一個例子就是您的房屋窗戶 - 在晴朗的一天，您毫不費力地看著。但是，外面有人可能會看到反思。這是因為玻璃會反射一些光，並傳遞其他。由於外部是_SO_明亮的，因此大量的光反映回外面的觀察者。這淹沒了從內部到外部傳遞的任何光線。另一方面，室內觀察者是窗戶的許多光線傳輸的光線，因此任何反射的光都被傳輸的光淹沒了。您會注意到晚上的相反，當您打開燈光時，室外是黑暗的。現在，室內觀察者會看到很多反思，外部觀察者毫不費力地凝視了。桌子內的明亮燈光使內部明亮。有些燈被洩漏到您的眼睛上 - 這就是您所看到的。其他燈會反射到底部鏡子上，後鏡會反射回。一些_ that_燈光到達了您的眼睛，但另一個部分會反映回底部的鏡子，等等。這就是為什麼您會看到許多副本的原因 - 這也是每個反射變得昏暗和調暗的原因 - 一些燈光逃脫，而另一個則被吸收。每次僅反映一個分數。它與投影圖像無關。
Why are PIN codes not needed for online transactions?,"Credit cards and debit cards, historically, worked with different banking networks and were developed with different mindsets. Credit cards chose to focus on signatures in the early days, while debit cards chose to use PINs. With that history, though debit and credit cards have sort of merged into a very similar style of transaction, they still hold onto some of the early designs for how those networks operated. There hasn't really been a need for changing the way credit cards worked, and introducing PINs for those cards would be a very big change that people probably wouldn't be happy with. --- There are some more details in an answer to a similar question here: _URL_0_",為什麼在線交易不需要PIN代碼？,從歷史上看，信用卡和借記卡與不同的銀行網絡合作，並以不同的心態開發。信用卡選擇在初期專注於簽名，而藉記卡則選擇使用引腳。有了這段歷史，儘管借記卡和信用卡已合併為非常相似的交易方式，但它們仍然堅持一些早期設計，以實現這些網絡的運行方式。實際上並不需要更改信用卡的工作方式，為這些卡介紹別針將是一個很大的變化，人們可能對此不滿意。---在此處回答類似問題的答案中還有更多細節：_url_0_
"What is an orchestral conductor doing, and how can everyone follow what he's doing regardless of what instrument they have?","He's keeping time. Each swing of the arm is a ""tic"" in the temp of the piece which all musicians, regardless of instrument need to keep in synch.

"Why can't governments print ""temporary"" money to cover important expenses?","They do, and it causes inflation because the money doesn't have any material value behind it. Money is just something we use to represent value. Without creating the value, the printed money isn't anything more than paper, which in turn, makes every piece of money less valuable.They do, but they can't print ""temporary"" money. The money printed is real money, which can kick off inflation as /u/onyourkneestexaspete said. Money has to be a permanent store of value otherwise its worthless. ""Temporary"" money would have no value since its only good for a short time.",政府為什麼不能打印“臨時”資金來支付重要的費用？,他們這樣做，這會導致通貨膨脹，因為錢背後沒有任何物質價值。金錢只是我們用來代表價值的東西。沒有創造價值，印刷的錢不僅僅是紙，這又使每塊錢的價值降低了。印刷的錢是真實的錢，可以按 /u /onyourkneestexaspete啟動通貨膨脹。金錢必須是永久性的價值存儲，否則毫無價值。“臨時”資金沒有價值，因為它在短時間內只有好。
"Why can humans eat almost anything, yet so many foods like chocolate, grapes, and xylitol are dangerous for dogs and other mammals?","The premise of your question is basically flawed. We can't eat almost anything. About half of the red berries in existence are poisonous to us but not to birds, for example. The same is true about mushrooms. Also, not everything that is edible is food. Uncooked grains are edible, but you would eventually die if that's all you ate. OTOH, if you cook it into bread, you're pretty much good to go.Selection bias. All the things humans eat are considered ""food."" The things that animals can eat that we can't aren't. We don't raise them as crops or otherwise pay them much attention. We don't go looking in the wild for new and interesting things that poison us to feed our dogs and see if *they* like itDifferent animals lack enzymes to process certain foods. This is why many foods we eat are poisonous to dogs.Lots of animals have different constitutions. Heck, dogs eat grass. I wouldn't recommend trying that.Not a lot of dogs tend to come from tropical environments where chocolate and grapes are common. Meanwhile a dog can eat all kinds of stuff that would kill you or I. This is more of a situation where a handful of ""normal"" foods by human standards will adversely affect humans, but ultimately we're a lot more digestively picky that most other animals.While we can't eat almost anything as many of the posters have mentioned we can eat many more things than more many other animals out side of dedicated scavengers who have specialized guys and microorganism in their body for dealing with rotting meat/vegetable matter. So I say OP isn't totally wrong but just didn't phrase the question right. To answer OPs question, it cause we learned to process food and make it edible. You can eat a raw potato but the energy you get from it is minimal compared tonic you cooked it. Also it would not be good on your insides.Different species have different physiologies Dogs can eat raw and rotting meat whereas it would kill or sicken a human.",人類為什麼幾乎可以吃任何東西，但是巧克力，葡萄和木糖醇等許多食物對狗和其他哺乳動物都是危險的？,您的問題的前提基本上是有缺陷的。我們幾乎不能吃任何東西。例如，大約一半的紅漿果對我們有毒，但對鳥類沒有毒。蘑菇也是如此。另外，並非所有可食用的都是食物。未煮熟的穀物是可食用的，但是如果您全力以赴，您最終會死亡。OTOH，如果您將其煮成麵包，那麼您可以很好地選擇。選擇偏見。人類吃的所有東西都被認為是“食物”。動物可以吃的東西我們不能吃。我們不會以農作物的形式飼養牠們，也不會引起他們的大量關注。我們不會在野外尋找毒害我們餵狗的新事物，看看是否 *它們是否喜歡不同的動物，缺乏酶來處理某些食物。這就是為什麼我們吃的許多食物對狗有毒的原因。哎呀，狗吃草。我不建議您嘗試。不要有很多狗來自熱帶環境，那裡的巧克力和葡萄很常見。同時，一隻狗可以吃各種會殺死您或我的東西。這更多的是，按照人為標準，少數幾種“普通”食物會對人類產生不利影響，但最終我們更加消化的挑剔是其他動物。雖然我們幾乎不能吃任何東西，因為許多海報都提到，我們可以吃很多東西，而不是其他許多動物，這些動物的專用清道夫在他們的體內有專門的人和微生物，因為他們可以處理腐爛的肉/蔬菜事情。因此，我說OP並不是完全錯誤的，但只是沒有正確的說法。要回答操作問題，這是因為我們學會了處理食物並使其可食用。您可以吃一個原始的土豆，但是從中獲得的能量是最小的，將其煮熟的滋補品。這對您的內部也不好。不同的物種具有不同的生理，狗可以吃生和腐爛的肉，而它會殺死或生病。
How are those huge cranes that work on skyscrapers setup/made taller/moved to really high floors?,"They're modular and self-assembling. The first structural piece under the rotation head, the lifter module, is more complex than the rest; it includes slides and jacks. The complete assembly process involves anchoring the base and setting up the horizontal arm. Once that's ready, the lifter module jacks up the head and the arm, and the crane lifts a structural segment off a truck and into place. Once the new segment is bolted in, the jacks retract and are bolted onto the new top structural segment. This process is repeated until the crane is as tall as it needs to be. Disassembly is the same process in reverse, with a caveat. If there is more than one crane involved, they may build around a crane within the building, so long as at least one crane is outside to lift out the pieces. The last crane, however, always has to have enough clear space to disassemble itself in the same process in reverse that it assembled itself with.",那些在摩天大樓設置/使高層的巨大起重機如何工作？,它們是模塊化的和自組裝的。旋轉頭下方的第一個結構件是舉重器模塊，比其餘部分更複雜。它包括幻燈片和千斤頂。完整的組裝過程涉及錨定基座並設置水平臂。準備就緒後，升降機模塊將頭和手臂抬起，起重機將結構性段從卡車上抬起並到位。一旦將新段固定在螺栓上，插孔會縮回並螺栓固定到新的頂部結構段。重複此過程，直到起重機最高的高度為止。拆卸是相反的過程，並有一個警告。如果涉及多個起重機，它們可能會在建築物內的一個起重機周圍建造，只要至少一個起重機在外面抬出碎片。但是，最後一個起重機總是必須有足夠的清晰空間才能在相同的過程中拆卸自身與其與其組裝在一起。

"During the Middle Ages, what would happen if a country invaded another, and the invaded country couldn't afford to fight so it surrendered, but the invading country kept on fighting?","That's not really how treaties work. Treaties aren't like ""you get to keep all the land you 've taken,"" they always specify very exact borders. If Country B truly had no will to fight, they would have given up all of their land . If Country A didn't take advantage of the situation and got a treaty that wasn't as favorable as it could have been, tough shit; they should have thought of that before they signed the treaty. Of course, they could just break the treaty.

How are brain aneurysms diagnosed and treated?,"Brain aneurysms are usually asymptomatic. The only time that they can otherwise be diagnosed is if they grow large enough to start bleeding, which can cause severe headaches, a lot of uncontrolled vomiting, and in other cases, they can compress the surrounding structures and nerves in the brain and cause a dysfunction there. Doctors can also suspect aneurysms in susceptible individuals. A family history of aneurysms, certain heart defects, connective tissue diseases such as Ehler-Danlos syndrome, or kidney diseases such as Polycystic Kidney Disease also are known to be associated with brain aneurysms. In any case, the only way to know is through imaging, which can be done best by MRIs that allow you to see the blood vessels, or other forms of imaging such as a CT with a special dye that marks blood vessels clearly. The idea of using platinum coils in an aneurysm is that they loop around several times inside the wall of the aneurysm, and trigger blood clotting in that area. Once the aneurysm clots over completely, there's very little chance of it bursting or bleeding out.",如何診斷和治療大腦動脈瘤？,腦動脈瘤通常是無症狀的。否則他們唯一可以診斷出的時間是，如果它們長大足夠大以開始流血，這會引起嚴重的頭痛，很多不受控制的嘔吐，在其他情況下，它們可以壓縮大腦中的周圍結構和神經，並引起a功能障礙。醫生還可以懷疑易感人群的動脈瘤。眾所周知，動脈瘤，某些心臟缺陷，結締組織疾病（例如Ehler-Danlos綜合徵）或腎臟疾病（如多囊性腎臟疾病）的家族史也與腦動脈瘤有關。無論如何，唯一知道的方法是通過成像，可以通過MRI來做到最好的，從而使您可以看到血管或其他形式的成像，例如帶有特殊染料的CT，可以清楚地標記血管。在動脈瘤中使用鉑線圈的想法是，它們在動脈瘤壁的牆壁內幾次循環，並在該區域觸發血液凝結。一旦動脈瘤完全凝結，它就幾乎沒有機會爆發或流血。

The US has more youth playing soccer than any other nation in the world. Why don't we have our own Messi?,"We have a lot of kids who play soccer, but the vast majority are in recreational leagues, not serious youth development programs like Messi went through. Those are growing along with the domestic league, though - the MLS Academy system just started four or five years ago.US television doesn't view soccer as a potential money maker. No one wants to invest in soccer. I think potential soccer stars in the US are recruited to play other sports, because there is more money in it. College basketball sends scouts out to schools to solicit potential players, and I don't think any soccer programs in the US have enough funds to do that. Unfortunately, it all comes down to ads for beer and cars. If someone could prove that soccer can draw as much attention as football in the US, then they could sell ads, and networks would be motivated to air more soccer. No one wants to invest in the unknown potential of soccer.American football, basketball, and baseball are far more prestigious sports to play than soccer at the high school and college levels, and their pro leagues get a lot more attention and a lot more money than the MLS. So the best American youth athletes may play soccer along with several other sports when they are children, but if they have the talent to go far in football, basketball, or baseball, they will almost always focus on one of those sports over soccer.",美國比世界上任何其他國家都有更多的青年踢足球。為什麼我們沒有自己的梅西？,我們有很多踢足球的孩子，但是絕大多數是在休閒聯賽中，而不是像梅西這樣的認真青年發展計劃。不過，這些人與國內聯盟一起成長 -  MLS學院系統剛剛開始了四到五年前。美國電視不認為足球是潛在的賺錢者。沒有人願意投資足球。我認為美國潛在的足球明星被招募到參加其他運動，因為其中還有更多的錢。大學籃球將童子軍派往學校招募潛在球員，我認為美國沒有任何足球計劃可以做到這一點。不幸的是，這一切都取決於啤酒和汽車的廣告。如果有人能夠證明足球可以像美國足球一樣引起足球的關注，那麼他們可以出售廣告，而網絡將被激勵播放更多足球。沒有人願意投資足球的未知潛力。美國足球，籃球和棒球比在高中和大學水平上足球更具享有聲望的運動，而且他們的職業聯賽獲得了更多的關注和更多的關注和更多的錢比MLS。因此，最好的美國青年運動員可能會和其他幾項小孩一起踢足球，但是如果他們有才能在足球，籃球或棒球上走得更遠，他們幾乎總是專注於足球上的一項運動。

Why is mercury the chosen substance for determining the temperature?,"We actually don't use mercury anymore, we use alcohol.

Memory addressed by the CPU is done in a power of 2: With one address line you can have two addresses, with two address lines you can have four addresses, with three address lines you can have eight addresses, [ ], with 10 address lines you can have 1024 addresses, with 11 address lines you can have 2048 addresses, [ ] with 16 address lines you can have 65536 addresses, with 17 address lines you can have 131072 addresses, [ ] with 20 address lines you can have 1048576 addresses etc. So with disk space these days, one gigabyte is 1 000 000 000 bytes, and that is just marketing. With link speed, 125 megabytes per second is 1 000 000 000 bits per second, and that is the nature of the design.

What does growth mean in terms of a countries economy?,"The way I learned economic growth, the ways economic growth is measured is by increasing the production capacity the country has . War is famously known to help production , as the government wants every ounce of resources it can get to produce weaponry and other goods, and hence WWII is usually credited with officially ending the Great Depression. There's also growth that's caused by better quality of life for the residents, such as technological advances , increased literacy rates, decreased poverty rates, lower unemployment rates, better environments, etc. With these, people are more eager to spend money rather than to spend , and of course, with more spending, there's typically a healthier economy which leads to more growth.Economic growth simply means an economy grew in value. Value can be expressed as GDP . GDP is the TOTAL value of ALL goods and services that a country produces. For example, let's say in Year 1 the US earned $100b through selling goods and services. In year 2 they managed to earn $200b, which means they experienced economic growth. Extra: with growth, comes inflation. This is where the price level of all goods rises. This is because if an economy grows, people have more money to spend on items. Shop owners can increase their prices because they know people will continue to shop there",在一個國家的經濟方面，增長意味著什麼？,我學習經濟增長的方式，衡量經濟增長的方式是增加該國的生產能力。戰爭是有助於生產的著名人物，因為政府希望它可以為生產武器和其他商品所能獲得的每一盎司資源，因此，第二次世界大戰通常會因正式結束大蕭條而被認為。居民的生活質量更高，例如技術進步，識字率提高，貧困率下降，失業率下降，環境降低，環境等等。，當然，隨著支出更多，通常會有更健康的經濟，從而導致更多的增長。經濟增長僅意味著經濟增長的價值。值可以表示為GDP。GDP是一個國家生產的所有商品和服務的總價值。例如，假設在1年級，美國通過出售商品和服務賺了100B美元。在第二年，他們設法賺了200b美元，這意味著他們經歷了經濟增長。額外：隨著增長，通貨膨脹來了。這是所有商品價格上漲的地方。這是因為如果經濟增長，人們有更多的錢可以花在物品上。店主可以提高價格，因為他們知道人們會繼續在那裡購物

Why do you often feel to hot/cold when you want to sleep?,Your body temperature decreases to initiate sleep. The recommended temperature for a good night’s sleep is 60 to 67 degrees.

Why does rain make people tired?,"It's probably a combination of reasons. Humans like to be awake all day and sleep all night. And we take our cues from the sun. If it's raining it's darker, so our bodies think, hey almost time for bed! Let's get sleepy! The other reason is :When we're in our mommy's belly we're constantly surrounded by the sound of her body, her digestive system gurgling but mostly the sound of her blood circulating. Which is a constant rushing sound. Rain kinda sounds like that, just like a rolling car, or vacuum cleaner. This makes us feel safe and comfortable. And again sleepy. Fun facts about this: If you drive a long way and don't have any distracting sounds like a radio the sound of your car can cause 'highway hypnosis' causing you to relax and fall asleep behind the wheel. Babies, when they're tired fall alseep very easily in the car or when a vacuum cleaner is running. Because it reminds them of being inside mommy's belly.",為什麼雨會讓人們累？,這可能是一系列原因。人類喜歡整天醒著，整夜睡覺。我們從陽光下汲取了線索。如果正在下雨，那就太暗了，所以我們的身體想著，嘿，幾乎是時候上床了！讓我們困了！另一個原因是：當我們在媽媽的腹部中時，我們一直被她的身體聲音包圍，她的消化系統ging著，但主要是她的血液在流傳的聲音。這是一種不斷的匆忙聲音。雨聽起來像是這樣，就像滾動汽車或真空吸塵器一樣。這使我們感到安全和舒適。再次困了。關於此事的有趣事實：如果您開車很長一段路，沒有任何分心的聲音，就像收音機一樣，汽車的聲音可能會引起“高速公路催眠”，從而使您放鬆並在方向盤上入睡。嬰兒，當他們疲倦時，汽車或真空吸塵器正在運行時很容易跌落。因為它使他們想起媽媽的腹部。

Why does smoking preserve food?,"Smoking by itself is actually insufficient to properly preserve foods. Smoke is an antimicrobial and an antioxidant but only protects the outside of food, so it is usually combined with other processes like salt-curing and drying which protect the interior of food from bacterial growthMoisture is the reason food gets moldy, so by smoking it you dry it out and prevent the molding.",為什麼吸煙保存食物？,實際上，吸煙實際上不足以適當保存食物。煙霧是一種抗菌和抗氧化劑，但僅保護食物外部，因此通常與其他過程相結合，例如鹽固化和乾燥，保護食物的內部免受細菌生長的影響是食物發霉的原因，因此吸煙，您可以吸煙。將其乾燥並防止成型。
Why are Saturday morning cartoons idealized? What’s so different about them as opposed to other days’ cartoons?,"Way back when there weren't multiple channels whose only purpose was cartoons. There was a MARKET for cartoons, but not a huge market. What day and time are kids most likely to be available year-round to watch things marketed towards them? Saturday mornings.

What is CERN and what real problems can it cause?,"CERN is basically trying to find out the origins of our universe and how everything works by using a very large particle accelerator to accelerate particles to 99.99991% the speed of light and have them collide with one another. When these particles collide they break apart and that is when we can see what holds particles together and how things work. Only problem is that there is years of data to go through and experimentally proving everything will take a long time. There is no real threat from this, what you see online is just that, ""conspiracy theories."" People believing that smashing particles will create a black hole and destroy the worldCERN studies the science of how the universe works at the smallest scale, smaller than an atom. They are trying to prove or disprove our theories about how the universe works at such a small scale. This is important to understanding how our universe came into being. CERN only makes smaller-than-atom sized things, and only for billionths of a second at a time. It learns what it can by scanning them in that time, they analyzing that scan for months and months. The things they make are new and exciting and sometimes sound scary, but nothing they make is a danger to us - all of it exists all around the universe, just not exactly where and when we need it to scan it.",什麼是CERN，它會導致什麼真正的問題？,CERN基本上試圖通過使用非常大的粒子加速器將顆粒加速至99.99991％的光速，並讓它們相互碰撞，從而找出我們宇宙的起源以及一切如何工作。當這些粒子發生衝突時，它們會分解，那就是我們可以看到將顆粒凝聚在一起的東西以及事物的工作原理。唯一的問題是，有多年的數據需要通過，並通過實驗證明一切都需要很長時間。這沒有真正的威脅，您在網上看到的只是“陰謀理論”。人們認為，粉碎顆粒會產生黑洞並破壞世界界的科學，即宇宙的工作方式最小，比原子小。他們試圖證明或反駁我們關於宇宙在如此小規模的工作方式的理論。這對於理解我們的宇宙的形成非常重要。Cern只製作小於原子大小的事物，並且一次僅適用於十億分之一。它通過在那個時候掃描它們來了解它可以進行的，他們分析了幾個月和幾個月的掃描。他們所做的事情是新穎而令人興奮的，有時聽起來令人恐懼，但是它們沒有什麼是對我們的危險 - 所有這些都存在於整個宇宙周圍，而不是完全需要何時何地掃描它。
What is the process of photographers when taking pictures of the supermoon?,There's really not much to it beyond needing that longer lens to zoom in more. Since the moon is being lit up by the sun the exposure times are just like taking a picture of anything outdoors in the middle of the day so it can be a handheld shot. Think of it like wanting a picture of a specific person's face in the other side of a football stadium. As long as you have a lens that gets you close enough you can get the image you want.,攝影師拍照時的過程是什麼？,除了需要更長的鏡頭可以放大更多的鏡頭外，實際上並沒有太多。由於月亮被陽光照亮，曝光時間就像在一天中間室外的任何東西拍照，因此可以是手持式鏡頭。想想它就像想要在足球場另一側的特定人的臉的照片一樣。只要您擁有足夠接近的鏡頭，就可以獲得所需的圖像。

"In Sci-fi movies, why are alien organisms almost always silicone based?","Silicon is the other element other than carbon that would form long complicated bonds that life could evolve around. Though it is almost certain that another life form would be carbon based this gives a way of creating a ""totally new life form"".It's silicon .. Not silicone. Silicon is the next element after carbon with the same characteristics. It's abundant and in most cases you can substitute carbon with silicon and form similar compounds. Eg ch4 is methane, a flammable gas. SiH4 is silane, another flammable gas.First off, I wouldn't say sci-fi movies ""almost always"" have silicon-based life forms. I don't think I 've seen that idea used in a long time, in fact. Secondly, take a look at a periodic table. Silicon is directly underneath carbon, which means that in theory, it could have very similar properties. In practice, this turns out not to be true.

"LI5, the current patent controversy between the top tech companies Google, MSFT, Apple, etc.","Before the 80s software was covered by copyrights instead of patents where unless you copied something exactly you were not liable to be sued for stealing someone's ideas. However large companies wanted more protection of their software and after some court cases including some at the supreme court they changed the rules and started allowing patents of software ideas rather then just a copyright on the specific code. The idea was that it would give inventors and programmers more incentive to come up with new ideas as they would have more legal protections from having their ideas stolen. However because patents can be very vague they ended up issuing patents to lots of things that maybe were not new concepts, such as ""transmitting data over the internet"". So instead of encouraging innovation it led to companies getting issued patents for simple things everyone did and then sue each other for ""stealing"" ideas. Also some lawyers saw that big software companies would just payout settlements to avoid going to court and decided to just sue every company with big money with the hopes of getting a fat payout to make them go away. So now companies will pay lots of money for the patent rights for stuff that should not have been patented in the first place just so they can say ""if you sue me for patent infringement then I have patents also and will sue you right back!"".

When you're that close to a huge painting, you literally can't see anything else. Your entire field of vision is consumed by this intense color field. The color kind of radiates on to you. Rothko's work was important because it was a pretty big influence on this notion of ""pure expression"" or ""direct experience"". It doesn't operate through language, symbols, or cultural understands. It's mean to be just something you feel, free of associations with anything else. It's important to note that Rothko isn't just important for making this kind of work, but also for talking about it quite extensively. Rothko was a very famous painter even before he started making abstract paintings, and he was quite popular and well respected. His transitions from representational and abstract works, along with his public writing/teaching/lectures/etc. on the subject makes him an enormously important figure in the history of art and the development of contemporary art theory.",有人可以解釋一下馬克·羅斯科（Mark Rothko）的作品如何以及為什麼被視為藝術，以及我如何欣賞它們？,您是否曾經見過Rothko？它製造了巨大的差異。首先，它們是大繪畫。其次，他一直希望人們靠近他們。IIRC他說理想的觀看距離是18英寸。對您。羅斯科的作品很重要，因為它對“純表達”或“直接體驗”的概念的影響很大。它不會通過語言，符號或文化理解來運作。這是您覺得的意思是，與其他任何事物無關。重要的是要注意，Rothko對製作此類工作並不重要，而且還非常廣泛地談論它。Rothko甚至在他開始製作抽象繪畫之前也是一位非常著名的畫家，並且他非常受歡迎且受到尊重。他從代表性和抽像作品以及他的公開寫作/教學/講座等方面的轉變使他成為藝術史和當代藝術理論的發展中非常重要的人物。
"Smartphone ""rooting"" and ""crapware.""","""Crapware"" refers to all of the pre-installed apps that you don't want, but the device will not allow you to uninstall. ""Rooting"" means basically taking control of the device in such a way that you can do things that it normally doesn't permit you to do, including uninstalling ""uninstallable"" apps. The term comes from UNIX operating systems, where, aside from the normal user accounts, there is a ""root"" account that has absolute permission to do anything it wants, and will not be restricted in any way by the operating systemI know nothing about crapware, though l imagine it may refer to the stuff that your phone company preloads onto your phone that you can't get rid of without rooting. Rooting means unlocking administrator level access to your phone, so you can change the underlying programming that your phone uses to operate or use programs that would otherwise be incompatible or restricted. Rooting allows a person to change things like ""overclocking"", meaning that it allows them to remove restrictions on how hard their processor can work - this can be dangerous in that it can burn out your processor or damage other hardware in the phone, but if used correctly it simply gets more performance out of the phone without making any hardware upgrades. Rooting often voids any warranty on the phone unless you can reset the phone to factory defaults before attempting to redeem a warranty, and it can lead to stability issues and crashing, even ""bricking"" the phone , and should therefore not be done by anybody who is not capable of understanding and executing the detailed instructions for rooting or is and comfortable with the risks.

; Bohr vs Einstein puzzle solution.,"The correct answer is that you have the same amount of B in A as there is A in B. Consider this: each container has 100 units of liquids A and B. The ladle can carry 10 units. In the first scoop, you have 10 units of A in the ladle. You transferred it to container B. Now Container A has 90 units of A. Container B has 100 units of B and 10 units of A. When you take a scoop from container B, you have about 0.91 units of A, and 9.09 units of B . You add this to container A. Now container A has 90.91 units of liquid A, and 9.09 units of B. However, container B still has the same proportion of liquid A and B after the first mixing - namely, 10/110 liquid A, and 100/110 liquid B. This translates to 9.09 units of liquid A, and 90.9 units of liquid B.We can use reductio ad absurdum to show that A and B have the same volume. Let's assume that we end up with more liquid A than liquid B . But how can we get this result? Since no liquid is added or removed, the split will always be equal and opposite. If one container has 60%/40%, the other must have 40%/60%, or 90%/10% and 10%/90%. Each of the two liquids must add always up to 100%. There is never a situation where you have 70%/30% and 30%/69% because that one percent cannot just disappear. Since adding or removing liquid is the only way to get more of one liquid than the other, we have to conclude that the the amount of A in B and B in A are the same. You can work through the math like others have done, but this is an intuitive way of thinking about the problem.",;Bohr vs Einstein拼圖解決方案。,正確的答案是，您在A中的B量與A中的B相同。考慮以下內容：每個容器都有100個液體A和B。鋼包可以攜帶10個單位。在第一個勺子中，您有10個單位的鋼包。您將其傳輸到容器B。現在容器A有90個單位A。容器B具有100個單位B和10個A。b。您可以將其添加到容器A中。現在容器A具有90.91單位的液體A和9.09單位。但是，容器B在第一次混合後仍具有相同的液體A和B的比例 - 即10/110液體A，，A和B和100/110液體B.這轉化為9.09單位的液體A和90.9單位的液體B.我們可以使用還原型荒謬來表明A和B具有相同的體積。假設我們最終會獲得比液體B多的液體A。但是我們如何獲得這個結果？由於沒有添加或除去液體，因此分裂始終相等且相反。如果一個容器具有60％/40％，則另一個容器必須具有40％/60％，或90％/10％和10％/90％。兩種液體中的每一個都必須始終添加高達100％。從來沒有這樣的情況，您擁有70％/30％和30％/69％，因為那百分之一不能消失。由於添加或去除液體是獲得比另一種液體更多的液體更多的唯一方法，因此我們必須得出結論，A中的A中的a量是相同的。您可以像其他人一樣進行數學工作，但這是思考問題的直觀方式。

"How do brands manufacturing non-concentrated, natural fruit juice keep the taste constant?","I'm not so sure they do. I drink apple juice, grape juice, and orange juice and I notice they do change in taste year in and year out and also season in and season out as the source of the fruit changes as seasons change in different parts of the world. So answer is, they don't control it. Some batches are better than others.Most commercially-available year-round juices are infused with ""flavor packs"". These flavor packs are flavor extracts which are added to the juice to enhance the naturally-occurring flavor which tends to degrade over time. The most well-known example of this is orange juice, which must be stored for long periods of time in aseptic, oxygen-free tanks. During this period flavor tends to degrade at least slightly, so flavor packs are added to bring back and at least mimic the natural flavor of fresh juice.",製造非濃縮的天然果汁的品牌如何保持味道恆定？,我不確定他們這樣做。我喝蘋果汁，葡萄汁和橙汁，我注意到它們確實每年都會變化，並且隨著世界各地的季節變化而變化的來源。所以答案是，他們無法控制它。有些批次比其他批次更好。大多數商業上可用的全年果汁都注入了“風味包”。這些風味包是添加到果汁中的風味提取物，以增強隨著時間的流逝而降低的天然風味。最著名的例子是橙汁，必須長時間存儲在無菌，無氧罐中。在此期間，風味往往會至少略微降解，因此添加風味包來帶回並至少模仿新鮮果汁的自然風味。

Why do big bags of chips have zero trans fats but the smaller version of the exact same chips contains trans fats?,"Because according to FDA regulations, any foods that has 0.5 g of trans fat or less PER SERVING can be labelled as trans fat free. In big bags of chips, the manufacturer can jiggle the serving size so that each serving will have less than 0.5 g. But small bags of chips are generally considered to contain only 1 serving, and so they can't divide out extra servings to screw with the numbers.Food product companies bribe regulators to allow the manufacturers to lie about their products. Sawdust is food if they label it microcrystalline cellulose. Water is broth if they inject it into meat. Rancid sludge is meat if treated with floor cleaner. Fat is fat-free if they can divide it into a large enough number of servings. This is why a sausage is 2.5 servings. Modern food products are not food. Nearly everything on the label is a lie. The product itself is a sham. Try eating food you prepare yourself for a week . Then try eating packaged food product for a week. Keeping calories the same, you will find you are still hungry after eating the packaged food product because no matter what the FDA permits, sawdust, water, and corn syrup are not chicken.

How do you move?,"Our brains learn how to move, and eventually store the information in our ""muscle memory""; the stuff that's so familiar to us, our mind can essentially take shortcuts to use it.

When we're very young, we first learn to grip things with our entire fist, then we have to learn to turn over, then we have to learn to crawl. Writing with a pen and pencil takes a certain combination of muscles that we have to consciously learn before we can unconsciously repeat.Your brain is telling the muscles what to do. Your brain is controlling this activity, such as walking. It decides that you need to put your right foot forward. There are different types of neurons, but the important one here is the motor neuron. The brain will control your actions by sending a signal down the motor neurons and to the correct muscles in your leg, causing it to move. It's not a one way thing either.

What makes humans want to kiss one another?,"> A person receives information about the person he or she is smooching by locking lips, Fisher said. A kiss transmits smells, tastes, sound and tactile signals that all affect how the individuals perceive each other and, ultimately, whether they will want to kiss again. > Women tend to be attracted to male partners with a different immune system makeup from their own, Fisher said. They subconsciously detect information about a partner's immune system through smell during kissing, she said. > Research led by Wendy Hill, professor of neuroscience at Lafayette College, looked at how kissing affects the hormones oxytocin, sometimes called the ""love hormone,"" which is associated with social bonding, and cortisol, a measure of stress. [Source] TL;DR: There's much more to kissing than what you might think. One of those is that you subconciously pick up things about the other person through smells you won't notice. There's also this [cracked] article that explains it quite well, despite being a comedy site: > It turns out Nerve 0 is directly connected to the regions of the brain associated with sex and gives your nose a direct, private highway to your genitals. Well, that's interesting. What could that be for? > Scientists theorize that when you kiss someone, Nerve 0 picks up their pheromones and warns your body to start sending blood and good vibes down to your crotch as quickly as possible. It's important to note that Nerve 0 doesn't travel through your olfactory bulb at all, which means you can't actually smell any of the things your sex nerve is designed to pick up.

Difference between Special and General Relativity,"I'll explain the difference between them, without going into what either form of Relativity actually *is*: Special Relativity only deals with objects moving at constant speed. General Relativity extends Special Relativity, by figuring out how to deal with acceleration. Special Relativity doesn't actually require complicated maths either.

As in, I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics, and I don't know enough math do to general relativity.

"How does ""artificial flavoring"" work, and create something so distinct as grape or other fruits?","It's all chemistry. You start with a real grape and you sit down in the lab and try to figure out what it is in a grape that makes it \'grape like\' in flavor. You could physically break down the grape into a slurry, and then use mechanical processes like centrifuges, or chemical processes like solvents and acids to separate the different chemicals in the grape and then examine the individual molecules for ones that create the grape flavor, grape color, grape scent . When the chemicals responsible for the flavor and odor of the grape are isolated in this way, their structure can be studied, and using chemistry you can create a method of taking other chemicals and processing them in such a way that they form these same flavor compounds. Lastly once you have something viable, you test it for toxicity and eventually palletability. While the actual grape may contain hundreds of molecules responsible for it's subtle flavors, the artificial flavoring may contain only a few that are primary influences of grape flavor. The substances that create these flavors may appear in many other fruits and flavors as well but in differing ratios so study of grape flavor may discover compounds that are also responsible for berry flavor, or cherry flavor etc. Eventually a working set of ""fruit flavors"" are developed and over time the secret gets out and they become industry standard flavors. Many lemon and lime flavors for instance are just citric acid and sweetener.What we call 'flavors' are merely a mix of chemicals in the right portions. Scientists recreate these flavors by synthetically creating the chemical formula.",“人造調味料”如何起作用，並創建像葡萄或其他水果這樣的獨特的東西？,都是化學。您從真正的葡萄開始，然後坐在實驗室中，試圖弄清楚它在葡萄中是什麼，使其風味\'葡萄。您可以將葡萄物理分解成漿液，然後使用離心機等機械過程，或化學過程（例如溶劑和酸）將葡萄中的不同化學物質分開，然後檢查單個分子的單個分子，以產生葡萄的味道，葡萄顏色，葡萄香。當以這種方式隔離葡萄的風味和氣味的化學物質時，可以研究它們的結構，並且可以使用化學方法創建一種服用其他化學物質並加工它們的方法，使它們形成相同的風味化合物。最後，一旦您擁有可行的東西，就可以對其進行毒性和最終的耐受性測試。儘管實際的葡萄可能包含數百個針對其微妙味道的分子，但人造調味料可能只包含少數主要影響葡萄風味的分子。產生這些口味的物質也可能出現在許多其他水果和口味中，但比率不同，因此研究葡萄風味的研究可能會發現漿果風味或櫻桃味等的化合物。是開發的，隨著時間的流逝，秘密已經脫掉，它們成為行業標準口味。例如，許多檸檬和檸檬味只是檸檬酸和甜味劑。我們所說的“風味”僅僅是正確部分中的化學物質的混合物。科學家通過合成創建化學配方來重現這些口味。

How are wells built?,"Wells are not technically built, they are drilled. In reference to a water well, a company will do some research to see if they can drill a well in the desired area. This all depends on location, ground type, and various other things. If a well is drillable they will bring out a truck, that is basically a small oil derrick, and begin drilling the well. Depending on you location and ground type the depth of the well will vary. Some places have underground ""rivers"" and can be relatively shallow wells, on the other had, some need to be deeper so that more water will seep into the vacant area that is created by the drilling.

What makes raindrops large sometimes but small other times? And is the size of raindrops indicative of how much longer the rain will fall?,"Raindrops form when water vapour in the atmosphere clusters around microscopic solid particles in a process called nucleation. Nucleation is reversible. As water molecules attach themselves to cluster, other molecules are leaving. There is a point called the *critical nuclear size*, at which point the cluster of water molecules is stable. This is the point at which a raindrop forms. The critical nuclear size /critical radius is controlled by temperature. The mathematics tells us that as the temperature is lowered, the critical radius decreases. Hopefully this answers your first question, and if I'm wrong I'd very much like to be called out on it! Cunningham's Law and all that ;) Ultimately, though, the answer lies in thermodynamics.You need to know that all precipitation starts as ice and as it falls to the ground, the temperature heats up and it turns into flurries or snow or hail or raindrops that can vary in size depending on the ice that was crystallizing in the cloudsBasically the hotter it is the more dust and whatnot there is in the atmosphere which makes bigger rain drops.

"Why aren't we concerned with bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms developing resistance to alcohol, chlorine, and other substances used to sterilize medical equipment (and hands)?","It is a good question.

They'll have casings around important stuff or gears that can allow a wrench to slip through the teeth without stopping. Maybe they have extra redundant machines.

why is the holocaust so much more popular than other historical genocides?,"Aside from having one of the highest death tolls , it receives attention partly because it was a new type of event. The word 'genocide' itself was only coined in 1944 to try and name what the Nazis had done. The Holocaust was a planned, deliberate attempt to completely wipe a race of people from the Earth, domestically and internationally, executed in a large-scale industrial fashion using all the tools of a developed 20th-century nation, and had the fascists not been stopped by war, they would have seen it through to completion. That's new. That hadn't happened before. That's why it's so studied. Sure, there had been lots of other mass killings and racist crimes of humanity -- but they weren't like the Holocaust. They usually fell into two categories: brutal massacres committed by invading armies and horrendously exploitative colonialism . The fact that Nazi Germany was a modern highly-developed nation also factors into it, I'm sure; it has a larger, more devastating impact to think of a modern educated developed country doing this, compared to say, the tyrant King Leopold and his absolute monarchy generations and generations ago. Likewise, Eurocentric views dominated as a matter of policy until very recently, so of course an event occurring in the heart of 20th century Europe has more shock value than some old business off on the Dark Continent. Then there's the fact that we have huge amounts of recorded testimony, photographic evidence, video evidence, etc of the Holocaust. There are a lot of factors.I'm not sure that ""popular"" is the right word! But I know what you mean. According to [Wikipedia], the holocaust was he second-worst genocide in history. That in itself makes it remarkable - but the fact that it came very close to wiping out the entire European Jewish population - 78% of that population was killed - makes it stand out above any othersIt was done by white people against whiteish people. There are still people alive who were involved. The Germans kept copious records.",為什麼大屠殺比其他歷史種族滅絕更受歡迎？,除了擁有最高的死亡人數之一之外，它還受到關注，部分原因是這是一種新型事件。“種族滅絕”一詞本身僅在1944年才創造，以嘗試命名納粹的所作所為。大屠殺是一種計劃，故意的嘗試，是在國內和國際上完全擦拭地球人的一群人，以大規模的工業方式使用20世紀發達國家的所有工具以大規模的工業方式執行，而法西斯主義者沒有被停止在戰爭中，他們會看到它完成的。這是新的。那以前從未發生過。這就是為什麼這樣研究的原因。當然，還有許多其他大規模殺戮和人類種族主義罪行 - 但它們不喜歡大屠殺。他們通常分為兩類：由入侵軍隊犯下的殘酷大屠殺和可怕的剝削性殖民主義。我敢肯定，納粹德國是一個現代備受發展的國家，這一事實也是如此。考慮到一個現代受過教育的發達國家，它具有更大，更具破壞性的影響，與說暴君國王利奧波德及其絕對君主制的世代和幾代人相比。同樣，直到最近，歐洲以歐洲為中心的觀點一直佔據政策，因此當然，在20世紀歐洲中心發生的事件比黑暗大陸上的一些舊業務更具震驚價值。然後是一個事實，我們有大量的大屠殺記錄證詞，攝影證據，視頻證據等。有很多因素。我不確定“流行”是正確的詞！但是我知道你的意思。根據[Wikipedia]的說法，大屠殺是他在歷史上的第二次種族滅絕。這本身使它變得異常出色 - 但事實非常接近消滅整個歐洲猶太人的人口 -  78％的人口被殺 - 使其超越了其他人，這是白人對白人的反對。仍然有活著的人參與其中。德國人保留了豐富的記錄。
Why does my stationary leg hurt when I ride a skateboard?,"More to the point, it is almost like doing a one legged squat. In addition to holding all your weight up, you are lowering yourself several inches each time you kick/push with the other leg. I have a adult sized kick scooter where I experience the same thing. I could kick all day, but switch legs often because of the fatigue in the leg on the board.you have two legs for a reason the weight is meant to be distrusted across both of them. When you kick / push not only are you putting all of wight on one leg but you are also using extra muscles to keep your balance. That can can exert a lot of stress on said leg. As with any form of excessive If you skate often though your legs should get stronger up to a point and it shouldn't be so bad later down the road you might not even notice it. Of course if you've been on a hiatus then yes you would feel the effects to a greater extent.",當我騎滑板時，為什麼我的固定腿受傷？,更重要的是，幾乎就像做一個腿下蹲一樣。除了舉起所有的重量外，每次用另一支腿踢/推動幾英寸，您還會降低自己。我有一個成人尺寸的踢腳踏板車，我經歷了同樣的事情。我可以整天踢，但是由於板上的腿疲勞的疲勞，經常切換腿。您有兩條腿，原因是重量在兩個腿上都不信任。當您踢 /推時，您不僅將所有Wight都放在一條腿上，而且還使用額外的肌肉來保持平衡。這可能會對上述腿施加很大的壓力。與任何形式的過多形式一樣，如果您的腿應該會變得更強壯，直到一點點，那麼以後再好不好，您甚至可能不會注意到它。當然，如果您陷入了中斷，那麼是的，您會在更大程度上感覺到效果。
What is the significance of the MPAA joining the W3C?,"The World Wide Web Consortium defines the specifications of the web. It's largely an organization of technology companies and publishers trying to agree on standards to move the technology forward. As streaming audio/video is being increasingly standardized , the MPAA naturally would like to have early input into how it's works - not unlike how Bloomberg cares about RSS. The controversy is largely because MPAA has for years fought the industry rather than worked with it, so most people perceive it as a way for the MPAA to slow down tech or make a fuss about DRM rather than a step in the right direction to offer good solutions. What does that mean to the average Joe? Well, for years there wasn't a standardized way to do video on the web. So Flash emerged, and Flash sucked. For years Adobe had a monopoly on it, and it's the reason a lot of early video didn't play on your iPhone . HTML5 streaming video fixed that by pushing it as a standard that every vendor could implement on largely their own. Lots of technology like that will emerge and evolve over the coming years. How it affects the day-to-day for the non engineer in the industry is usually non-obvious . It simply means the MPAA will be present at a few tech meetings earlier than they have in the past. If you're an optimist, that means that they've learned their lesson somewhat and will try to work with the industry instead of fighting it. If you're a pessimist, it means they're going to make a short-sighted fusses that slow down the technology evolving.",MPAA加入W3C有什麼意義？,萬維網聯盟定義了網絡的規格。它在很大程度上是一個技術公司和發行商的組織，試圖就推動技術向前發展的標準達成共識。隨著流媒體/視頻的標準化越來越標準化，MPAA自然希望早日投入其工作原理 - 與彭博社的關心如何關心RSS不同。這場爭議很大程度上是因為MPAA多年來一直在與該行業作鬥爭，而不是與之合作，因此大多數人都認為MPAA會減慢技術的速度或對DRM大驚小怪，而不是朝著正確的方向邁出一步來提供良好的方向。解決方案。這對普通喬意味著什麼？好吧，多年來，沒有一種標準化的方法可以在網絡上進行視頻。因此，閃光出現了，閃光吮吸。多年來，Adobe壟斷了它，這就是許多早期視頻在iPhone上播放的原因。HTML5流視頻通過將其作為一個標準來修復了該視頻，每個供應商都可以在很大程度上實施。在未來幾年中，許多這樣的技術將出現和發展。它如何影響行業非工程師的日常工作，通常不太明顯。這僅意味著MPAA將比過去早一些技術會議參加。如果您是樂觀主義者，那意味著他們已經有些學到了課程，並將嘗試與行業合作而不是與之抗爭。如果您是一個悲觀主義者，那意味著他們將發出短視的大驚小怪，以減慢技術的發展。

Why are textbooks so expensive?,"Because only a small number are printed. If you print a million of something, the costs are divided across that large number and it can be cheaper.

"Why is it when a show or movie has subtitles, we can’t help but read them?","Two things 1. Remember how you spent the first several years of your life sitting in rooms reading stuff all day? and then you go to work and read stuff all day?, etc, etc. Your brain does - so when it sees words, even without you telling it to, it goes ""ooh, I know what to do here"" and reads them. The brain just gets conditioned to read words that it becomes automatic. You can notice yourself doing this in other parts of your life too where you will automatically read stuff even if you weren't specifically trying to focus on it 2. Often in movies where there's dialogue being exchanged between two characters there's not that much else going on but the subtitles are changing, so they are actually the most ""interesting"" thing happening. Next time your watching a movie with subtitled but not trying to pay attention to the subtitles pay attention to when you pay attention to them and you'll probably notice that you're more likely to notice what the subtitles are doing when there isn't much else going on than you are during the action sequences.",為什麼當節目或電影帶有字幕時，我們不禁會讀它們？,兩件事1.還記得您一生的頭幾年坐在整天閱讀東西的房間裡嗎？然後您整天上班和閱讀東西嗎？等等。大腦只能讀取自動的單詞。您也會注意到自己在生活的其他部分也這樣做，即使您沒有專門嘗試專注於它。但字幕正在發生變化，因此它們實際上是最“有趣”的事情。下次您以字幕觀看電影時，但不嘗試注意字幕時請注意當您注意它們時，您可能會注意到您更有可能注意到字幕沒有比您在動作序列中發生的事情要多得多。
Why do we have to pay for internet? And why is there a limit?,"You're not paying for ""the internet"". You're paying for a company to *connect* you to the internet. They build the infrastructure, they run a lot of very high-end, very specialised equipment, and they spent a *lot* of money on it. They're not going to let you use those for freeThe Internet is a network. We say that nobody ""owns"" the Internet because that term refers to the connection between many different computers; you can own a server or a cable but not the concept of the Internet itself. To connect to the Internet, your computer needs to route through many servers and cables. These cost money to install, maintain and expand, which is part of the job of the Internet service provider. That's why you have to pay your ISP for access. By ""limit,"" are you referring to caps on data transfer? It actually doesn't really matter to the ISP that much how much data you are transferring in total, but it cares about the peak demand, since that determines what the capacity of the network should be. More capacity costs more money. Data caps are just one way for the ISP to generate income to cover its costs and make a profit; ISPs generally think that billing methods more accurate to what you cost specifically would be confusing to consumersThe internet is a series of computers that are all connected to one another, using a commonly agreed upon way to communicate. Someone has to maintain the connections between those computers - there are millions of miles of copper and fiber optic cables, thousands of servers to direct traffic, hundreds of servers to perform DNS lookups etc - in order to keep the internet going. While no single entity owns the entire internet, companies do own and maintain parts of the communication system.

"How comes different phone chargers take widely different time to charge the same phone,despite all being rated 5V 1A?","The usb standard originally allowed for only 500mA to be drawn per port. This isn't really enough for smartphones and especially power hungry tablets etc., so the manufacturers came up with a way for chargers to indicate they were willing to supply more power to the device. The device charging circuit can then draw more power than that safely - without that signaling the device could try to draw more than the charger/port can supply and possibly burn it out. Sadly there were different methods chosen - some short together the data leads, some use different resistors between them or between them and the ground pin etc. The wrong charger/cable with the wrong device won't step up to the higher current. I've just bought a small gadget from dealextreme which sits in the usb port and tells you how much current is being drawn from it. My cables vary from 0.3 to 0.95A to the same device - I'm in the process of labeling them and exploring the various combinations of charger, cable and device. Tl;Dr it's complicated.",儘管所有電話充電器的額定值為5V 1A，但如何花費不同的時間來充電同一手機？,USB標準最初僅允許每個端口繪製500mA。對於智能手機，尤其是飢餓的平板電腦等，這還不夠，因此製造商提出了一種充電器表明他們願意為設備提供更多電力的方法。然後，設備充電電路可以比安全地汲取更多的功率 - 沒有信號，設備可能會嘗試繪製比充電器/端口所能提供的更多功能，並可能將其燃燒出來。遺憾的是，選擇了不同的方法 - 一些數據引線，有些方法在它們之間或它們之間使用不同的電阻。我剛剛從Dealextreme購買了一個小型小工具，該小工具位於USB端口中，並告訴您從中抽出多少電流。我的電纜從0.3到0.95a到同一設備不等 - 我正在標記它們並探索充電器，電纜和設備的各種組合。Tl; Dr很複雜。
Why is mace (pepper spray) illegal in the UK?,"There is no such concept as ""defensive weapon"" in any of the UK legal systems.

If you were carrying a baseball bat outside a town park at 11 o\'clock on a Sunday morning you 'd be highly unlikely to be stopped by the police. If you had the same bat outside the same park at 2am the police would almost certainly consider it an offensive weapon. Also note that defending yourself in a threatening situation is perfectly legal in the UK, as long as you use ""proportional force"" and that you haven't pre-armed yourself with a weapon.",為什麼英國的梅斯（胡椒噴霧劑）是非法的？,在英國任何法律制度中，都沒有諸如“防禦武器”這樣的概念。在英國，唯一或主要意圖造成傷害的任何東西總是被視為進攻武器。請注意，使用的使用意圖很重要。如果您在周日早上11點\'時鐘外攜帶棒球棒在城鎮公園外面，那麼您不太可能被警察阻止。如果您在凌晨2點在同一公園外面有同一隻蝙蝠，那麼警察幾乎可以肯定會認為這是進攻性武器。另請注意，只要您使用“比例力量”，並且您還沒有用武器預先武裝自己，那麼在英國捍衛自己是完全合法的。
Can I take any antibacterial medicine for any bacterial infection?,"To answer your questions: no, and yes. Bacterial infections treated by antibiotics vary widely. There are gram negative and positive, cocci and bacilli and several other ways to isolate or classify organisms. A physician will order a culture/sensitivity test which takes several days to determine what cootie you're growing and what antibiotic it is most sensitive to. Antibiotic stewardship follows treating the infection with the least broad spectrum medicine available to avoid creating more resistant strains.

What is the force that causes you to think of someone moments before they call or text you?,"Coincidence, confirmation bias and faulty memory. There are no special forces. Rather, sometimes when you happen to think of someone they will contact you soon after. More frequently when you happen to think of someone, they won't contact you at all. Human memories are fairly flawed. Some of us might think we are masters of remembering stuff, but really, we aren't. Maybe rough lines, but details? Nope. And our memories are quite easy to influence as well, both by others and by ourselves. All of this leads to the situation where you are more likely to remember those times you were thinking of someone and they just happened to call you. That makes you believe someone is always calling you as you think of them and you confirm your bias with your flawed recollection. Just grab a notepad and start marking down every time someone crosses your mind, even for a moment. Write down when these people call you.

Why does the U.S. military use exciting action commercials and other fanfare for recruiting rather than just telling us what the threat is?,"Why does Bud Light have commercials of a guy playing ping-pong with Arnold Schwarzenegger instead of advertising its price and alcoholic content? Like any other advertiser, the Army spends millions trying to find the best way to sell themselves. The simplest answer is likely the exciting action commercials are the result of a group of very intelligent people studying data and crafting a pitch they think will attract the largest group of people. As with any commercial reaching millions, the results tend to be generic and inoffensive. There are many reasons I think they 'd avoid a ""Hitler is killing all these people"" commercial: * It's a complex situation. We're talking about a fifteen second commercial designed to grab your attention, not a WWII newsreel. * A commercial focusing on the enemy subconsciously reinforces the danger of serving in the armed forces. The single biggest downside to joining the military is that you could end up dead, and they obviously want to avoid anything that could reinforce that idea. * Hot-headed assholes yelling ""Let's go kill us some ISIS!"" is NOT what the military wants. The keywords they use instead are the more important indicators of military success that they're looking for. * Our enemy isn't exactly the most politically correct. The White House [refuses to even use the term ""radical Islam when referring to people like the Charlie Hebdo murders, for fear of alienating American Muslims and Muslim allies. The armed forces are likewise strongly recruiting Arabic-speakers and Muslim-Americans, and angry faces with turbans on your commercials won't help.",為什麼美國軍方會使用激動人心的行動廣告和其他大張旗鼓地招募，而不僅僅是告訴我們威脅是什麼？,為什麼Bud Light有一個與Arnold Schwarzenegger一起玩乒乓球的人的廣告，而不是宣傳其價格和酒精內容？像其他任何廣告商一樣，陸軍花了數百萬美元試圖找到自己出售自己的最佳方法。最簡單的答案可能是令人興奮的行動廣告是一群非常聰明的人學習數據並製作他們認為會吸引最大人群的球場的結果。與任何達到數百萬美元的商業一樣，結果往往是通用且無與倫比的。我認為他們避免“希特勒正在殺死所有這些人”的廣告有很多原因： *這是一個複雜的情況。我們談論的是15秒廣告，旨在引起您的注意，而不是第二次世界大戰新聞媒體。*專注於敵人的商業，潛意識加強了在武裝部隊中服役的危險。加入軍隊的最大缺點是您可能死了，他們顯然想避免任何可以加強這一想法的事情。*熱頭混蛋大喊：“讓我們殺了我們一些ISIS！”不是軍隊想要的。他們使用的關鍵字是他們想要的更重要的軍事成功指標。*我們的敵人在政治上並不是最正確的。白宮[甚至拒絕使用“激進的伊斯蘭教”一詞，因為擔心疏遠美國穆斯林和穆斯林盟友，例如查理·赫布多謀殺案。您的廣告上有頭巾的面孔無濟於事。

What exactly makes some genes dominant and others recessive?,"I remember that this was explained on Ask Science a year ago ; here's the link to the answer given, as it's really nice: _URL_0_ To paraphrase the analogy: Genes code for different things. Some genes code for different structural proteins. You can think of these genes as coding for bricks. Our ""good"" alleles code for rectangular bricks, and bad alleles code for spherical bricks. If you have one gene for each, you're going to be making both spherical bricks & rectangular bricks. But that's a problem - your building needs all rectangular bricks, and having some spheres and some rectangles doesn't build your building. You have loss of function, so that negative trait is dominant. In contrast, if a gene codes for an enzyme, it's likely to be recessive. These are like building trucks. A good truck works, and a bad one doesn't work. But, if you have some good trucks and some bad trucks , you might just have enough good trucks in total to transport the material you need from one place to another. Thus, we say that the bad trait is ""recessive"", because you're not going to experience full loss of function unless you have two bad alleles . Now, you might have some negative effects, particularly if you need a lot of the enzyme, but it's not going to be a total loss for the most part, and you may well be able to function on a day-to-day basis without major issuesIt all has to do with protein production. DNA codes for a certain protein which is how the trait is expressed. Take hair color for example: Brown hair is dominant over blonde, blonde hair is the absence of the protein for brown, so if there is even just one allele for brown you will have brown hair ",是什麼使某些基因占主導地位和其他基因的隱性？,我記得這是一年前在Ask Science上解釋的。這是給出的答案的鏈接，因為它真的很不錯：_url_0_來解釋類比：基因代碼不同事物。某些基因代碼不同的結構蛋白。您可以將這些基因視為編碼磚。我們的矩形磚的“好”等位基因代碼以及球形磚的壞等位基因代碼。如果您有一個基因，那麼您將同時製作球形磚和矩形磚。但這是一個問題 - 您的建築物需要所有矩形磚，並且擁有一些球體和一些矩形並不能建造您的建築物。您的功能喪失，因此負面特徵是主導的。相反，如果基因代碼為酶，則可能是隱性的。這些就像建造卡車。一輛好卡車工作，糟糕的卡車行不通。但是，如果您有一些好卡車和一些不好的卡車，您可能只有足夠的好卡車將所需的材料從一個地方運輸到另一個地方。因此，我們說不良特徵是“隱性的”，因為除非您有兩個不良等位基因，否則您不會經歷全部功能。現在，您可能會產生一些負面影響，尤其是如果您需要很多酶，但這在大多數情況下並不是全部損失，並且您很可能能夠在沒有的日常工作中運行主要問題與蛋白質的產生有關。DNA代碼某種蛋白質，這是表達性狀的方式。以頭髮的顏色為例：棕色頭髮在金發上占主導
How a recession causes lower gas prices.,"Gas prices are largely driven by gas demand. The *demand* for gas however isn't usually driven by prices.

Why trees produce different shapes/sizes of leaves.,"A thing to remember about evolution is that so long as a trait works well enough, and doesn't kill an organism or weaken it to the point of applying direct evolutionary pressure, it will remain. Leaves are a balance between energy expenditure and energy production. Trial and error from mutation and different plant branches of the evolutionary tree will lead to variety.Sometimes nature just does stuff because some component of an organism's genetics changes due to a mutation and that mutation carries on to its descendants. If it's a mutation that adds some advantage, odds are a little better that it'll be retained in the long term than if it's a mutation that doesn't convey any advantage because the organisms with it are a little better off than the organisms without it. But the ""harmless"" mutations can still occur, and can still get carried on. Tree leaves are like this. Sometimes their leaves have become adapted to specific circumstances that are best for their environment , and sometimes their shape isn't really part of some grand survival strategy to work better than other leaves. So a maple leaf has lobes but an elm leaf does not. And a birch leaf has teeth around its outside but a lilac bush does not. And an ash tree will have compound leaves with lots of leaflets but a beech's leaves are simple. Each might convey SOME advantage or other, but regardless of whether or not that's true, each does its job and the customized shape isn't enough of a disadvantage to cause that tree to die out.",為什麼樹木產生不同的葉子/尺寸。,關於進化的一件事是，只要一個特徵效果足夠好，並且不會殺死生物體或削弱其直接進化壓力的地步，它將保持。葉子是能源消耗和能源生產之間的平衡。突變和進化樹的不同植物分支產生的反複試驗將導致多種。如果是一個增加了一些優勢的突變，從長遠來看，它將保留的賠率比沒有傳達任何優勢的突變要好一點它。但是“無害”突變仍然可以發生，並且仍然可以繼續進行。樹葉是這樣的。有時，他們的葉子已經適應了最適合其環境的特定情況，有時它們的形態實際上並不是某種宏偉的生存策略的一部分，可以比其他葉子更好地工作。因此，楓葉有裂片，但榆樹葉沒有。樺木葉子周圍有牙齒，但淡紫色灌木叢沒有。一棵灰樹將有很多傳單的複合葉，但山毛櫸的葉子很簡單。每個人都可能傳達一些優勢或其他優勢，但是無論這是真的，每個都可以完成其工作，並且定制的形狀不足以使該樹死亡。
The five lesser-known types of magnetism?,"Basically, magnetic fields happen because electrons have small magnetic fields. There are various ways they can prefer to behave in a material, giving rise to their magnetic properties. Diamagnetism is most noticeable when there are no unpaired electrons in a material. This negates the magnetic moment of the electrons . It opposes any external magnetic fields by messing with the magnetic moment of the electrons' orbit. Every material will do this, but most of the time, other effects overwhelm it. Paramagnetism is sort of the opposite, when there are unpaired electrons. Those unpaired ones can point any which way they please and thus, can line up with an external magnetic field, amplifying it. The magnetic moment of an electron is much greater than the magnetic moment of it's orbit, so this effect outweighs diamagnetism if there are unpaired electrons. Ferromagnetism is like paramagnetism, except that it's so strong, the amplified field can sustain itself. The field generated by other electrons in the material is strong enough to get other electrons in the material to also line up, so it can keep the field by itself. Antiferromagnetism is the opposite, the unpaired electrons want to oppose eachother, so they have no magnetic field. The reasons why this would happen instead of ferromagnetism have to do with complicated energy level nonsense in various materials. Ferrimagnetism forms sheets, kind of. Antiferromagnetic materials have every electron trying to be opposite of it's neighbor, so it forms a checkerboard. Ferrimagnetic materials form rows as they try to be the same alignment in one direction but opposite alignment in the other direction. This usually results in a net magnetic field like a ferromagnet. Superparamagnetism is only found in tiny pieces of ferro or ferrimagnetic materials. They're small enough that their temperature causes them to switch the alignment of their magnetic field too quickly to produce a stable magnetic field in any given direction. But when an external field is applied, they align. It's like paramagnetism, but because the material is a better magnet in the first place, it's stronger than normal paramagnetism.",五種鮮為人知的磁性類型？,基本上，由於電子具有較小的磁場而發生磁場。他們有多種方式希望在材料中表現出來，從而產生其磁性。當材料中沒有未配對的電子時，直徑是最明顯的。這抵消了電子的磁矩。它通過將電子軌道的磁矩弄亂而反對任何外部磁場。每種材料都會做到這一點，但是大多數情況下，其他效果都淹沒了它。當有未配對的電子時，順磁性是相反的。那些不成對的可以指向他們所需的任何方式，因此可以與外部磁場對齊，並將其放大。電子的磁矩比其軌道的磁矩要大得多，因此，如果有未配對的電子，則這種效果大於Diamagnetism。鐵磁性就像promagnetism一樣，除了它是如此強大，放大的領域可以維持自己。材料中其他電子產生的場很強，可以使材料中的其他電子也可以排隊，因此它可以保留該場。反鐵磁性相反，未配對的電子希望彼此對抗，因此它們沒有磁場。這樣做的原因而不是鐵磁性的原因與各種材料中復雜的能量水平胡說八道有關。鐵磁性形成紙。抗鐵磁材料的每個電子都試圖與鄰居相反，因此它形成了棋盤。鐵磁性材料在一個方向上試圖成為相同的對準，但在另一個方向上對齊。這通常會導致淨磁場，例如鐵磁鐵。超級磁性僅在小鐵或鐵磁材料中發現。它們足夠小，以至於他們的溫度使他們過快地切換磁場的對齊方式，以在任何給定的方向上產生穩定的磁場。但是，當應用外部字段時，它們會對齊。這就像promagnetism一樣，但是由於材料首先是更好的磁鐵，所以它比正常的promagnetism強。

Why do the body-cells age?,"A few reasons. The most straightforward is that every time a cell copies it's DNA, it uses up a piece of the tail at the end of the DNA called the *telomere*. When a cell is out of telomere, fragments of the DNA itself start getting used and the cell goes into *telomere panic*. Each copy does damage to the DNA after that.",為什麼身體細胞會變老？,一些原因。最直接的是，每次單元格複製它的DNA時，它都會在DNA末端的一塊尾部，稱為 *端粒 *。當一個細胞超出端粒時，DNA本身的片段開始使用，並且細胞進入 *端粒恐慌 *。在那之後，每個副本會損壞DNA。
What is involved in porting a PS2 game like Metal Gear Solid 2 to Xbox 360/PS3 for an HD Collection?,"PS2 and X360/PS3 have different processor architectures. Which means that the same piece of code means different things to those machines. That's where emulators come in. An emulator is a software that reads a code that's written for a certain processor and ""translates"" it to work on another processor. Now to make an emulator work, you have to have a very good understanding of how both processors work, so you can make the translation process as smooth as possible.

"what is the real difference between a Prime Minister, President  &  a Premier of a country?","Many parliamentary democracies are republics as well, although some still have monarchs as their head of state . That last thing -- *head of state* -- is a key term here. The other term that goes with it is the *head of government*. The head of government heads the cabinet of ministers, and is often called the *prime* minister or simply the premier , but can also go by other titles, like chancellor. In some countries, like the US, this person is also the head of state in personal union. In others, like in most European countries, there is a distinct role as the head of state. Usually this is a president if it's a republic, or a monarch if not. If the role is distinct, it's usually mostly ceremonial, with some additional constitutional roles . Queen Elisabeth II, for example, is the head of state of well over a dozen countries from all over the world, but not the head of government in any of them. So, the important distinction here is between the head of state and the head of government, what they're called is just a matter of nomenclature and often rooted in tradition.",總理，總統和一個國家的總理之間有什麼區別？,許多議會民主國家也是共和國，儘管有些人仍然以君主為國家元首。最後一件事 -  *國家負責人 *  - 這裡是關鍵術語。附帶的另一個術語是 *政府負責人 *。政府負責人擔任部長內閣，通常被稱為 * Prime *部長或首要任職者，但也可以像大臣一樣被其他冠軍頭銜。在某些國家，例如美國，這個人也是個人聯盟的國家元首。在其他國家，就像在大多數歐洲國家一樣，作為國家元首起著獨特的作用。通常，如果是共和國，這是總統，或者是君主。如果角色與眾不同，則通常主要是禮儀，並具有額外的憲法角色。例如，伊麗莎白二世女王是來自世界各地的十幾個國家的國家負責人，但在其中任何一個國家都不是政府負責人。因此，這裡的重要區別在於國家元首和政府負責人，他們所謂的只是命名法，通常植根於傳統。

This plea is saying ""I don't admit I did it, but I'll let you go ahead and punish me anyway"". While the immediate effect is the same as a guilty plea, depending on your jurisdiction there may be some secondary benefits to *nolo contendere*. For instance, under US federal rules, a guilty plea can be taken as an admission of guilt in some later court case, while a no contest plea cannot be.",我不想競爭或不參加比賽,通常，法庭上有兩個可能的請求。有罪或無罪；“我承認我做到了，繼續懲罰我”或“我不承認我做任何事情，證明我錯了”。在某些情況下，您可以不參加比賽。這一請求說：“我不承認我做到了，但是我會讓你繼續前進並懲罰我。”雖然直接效果與有罪認罪相同，但根據您的管轄權， *nolo contendere *可能會有一些次要利益。例如，根據美國聯邦規定，在後來的一些法院案件中，可以將有罪的認罪視為對有罪的承認，而沒有任何競賽認罪。

"Who pays for anti-smoking ads, and why do they want us to quit?","Fun fact: the Truth anti-smoking ads are actually funded by the big tobacco comapnies. In the late 90's 47 states sued the tobacco industry for the medical financial burden their products put on the state's healthcare systems.

The ALF is responsible for the Truth advertising campaign.Smokers pay for those commercials with the tax they put on the cigarettesusually the government. they prefer having a healthy population so that tax money doesnt get lost trying to treat cancers and emphysemasWe all benefit from fewer people smoking.

These nerves aren't completely separated, so your brain senses an irritation in your throat, which triggers the cough reflex. This same association of nerve impulses causes many people to feel they have a sore throat/earache when in fact their ears are free of infection. Hope this helps!",為什麼我在使用Q-tips時突然咳嗽？,好的，基本上，您有兩條顱神經，可以向您的喉嚨供應，口腔，喉，氣管和外耳管。當您插入Q-TIP時，它會刺激這些神經，從而使您的大腦發出信號。這些神經並沒有完全分開，因此您的大腦會感受到喉嚨的刺激，從而觸發咳嗽反射。同樣的神經衝動的關聯使許多人感到自己的耳朵疼痛/耳痛，而實際上他們的耳朵沒有感染。希望這可以幫助！

Why do computers/programs freeze/crash?,"It means theyre working. when you get to the theoretical side of computer science, it's actually impossible to tell when something is in an infinite loop, or just taking a very long time. Generally, the computer has just come across a large amount of data it must go through, or may perhaps be waiting on a callback from some other program it dispatched. You see this a lot if you 've ever downloaded a small application from someone instead of a big budget program. sometimes when you feed a simple program lots of data it will ""not respond"" for hours on end because it's working really hard sorting through all the data you just gave it, and not responding to the operating system's requests for activity because it can't. Generally speaking, unless you have a logic flaw, the program will finish sometime, but you have no way of knowing when this will occur if you don't know how the program works or how much data was given to it', ""They are given an instruction that they can't complete.

That's the computer crash",為什麼計算機/程序凍結/崩潰？,這意味著他們工作。當您進入計算機科學的理論方面時，實際上不可能分辨出什麼時候在無限循環中，或者只是花了很長時間。通常，計算機剛剛遇到了大量數據必須通過的數據，或者可能正在等待其派遣的其他程序的回調。如果您曾經從某人那裡下載了一個小應用程序，而不是大型預算計劃，那麼您會看到很多。有時，當您為一個簡單的程序提供大量數據時，它會連續數小時“不響應”，因為它確實努力地對您剛剛提供的所有數據進行整理，而不是響應操作系統的活動請求，因為它不能。一般來說，除非您有邏輯缺陷，否則該程序將在某個時候完成，但是如果您不知道程序的工作方式或給出了多少數據，則無法知道何時會發生這種情況，”考慮到他們無法完成的指示。一次，我的家人排隊，我們每個人都要求我最小的兄弟姐妹來找我們。他涉水，直到他到達約10英尺。坐在地上哭了。那是電腦崩潰
How much of the music does a songwriter actually write?,"It is sort of complicated. Generally, the person credited as the ""writer"" comes up with the main composition, or chord structure and melody for the song. For instance- Sting is listed as the sole composer for ""Every Breath You Take"", because he came up with the chord structure- but when you think about that song, it is Andy Summers\' guitar riff that probably comes to mind. However- Sting pulls in a reported $2k per day in royalties, while Summers gets squat. The thought being that the other musicians are merely playing along to the already ""composed"" structure of the song. Yes- they are still ""writing"" their parts- but the structure already existed.It depends on the band, and the musicians. As a general rule of thumb most musical acts are directed by a producer though. Even classic musicians like The Beatles or The Doors were heavily produced. If you want to see the full credits for a song find it on [Discogs] and be sure to check out both the credits which are for a specific song, and the album credits which apply to all the songs on an album. Occasionally things are left out on the website, but it's generally very good and comprehensive.",詞曲作者實際寫的是多少音樂？,"這有點複雜。通常，被認為是“作家”的人提出了這首歌的主要作品，或和弦結構和旋律。例如，sting被列為“每一次呼吸”的唯一作曲家，因為他想出了和弦結構 - 但是當您想到那首歌時，Andy Summers \'吉他即興演奏可能會想到。然而，據報導，每天有$ 2,000美元的特許權使用費，而薩默斯則蹲下。人們認為，其他音樂家只是在演奏這首歌的“構成”結構。是的 - 他們仍在“寫”自己的部分 - 但結構已經存在。這取決於樂隊和音樂家。作為一般的經驗法則，大多數音樂行為是由製片人執導的。即使是像甲殼蟲樂隊或門這樣的經典音樂家也是如此。如果您想在[Discogs]上查看一首歌的完整學分，並確保查看特定歌曲的學分，以及適用於專輯中所有歌曲的專輯積分。有時候，網站上遺漏了事情，但通常非常好且全面。"
Why do we use implants for breast enlargement instead of something biological like stomache fat?,"Fat is a living tissue. Transplants of living tissue are more expensive and have higher risk of complications. Implants are biologically inert and relatively easy to implantThis actually is a thing, but you have to use large amounts of fat as not all of it ""takes"" and has arguably more complication potential than implants . The Wikipedia page for ""Breast Augmentation"" has a rather large section devoted to the method you should check out.This is a thing, relicating the fat and 'sculpting' the area youre taking fat from with liposuction, they then sterilize the fat, and reinject it but into the breasts this time. The only issue is that a lot of the time the fat will be reabsorbed and the procedure has to be re-done. No gangreen or completely disgusting affects unless its done improperly/with insterile equipment.Might also have to do with the structure of the breast and how the added fat is stored, stomach/thigh fat is used in Brazilian butt lifts so obviously fat transplants can work",為什麼我們要使用植入物進行乳房增大，而不是像生物學上喜歡胃脂肪的東西？,脂肪是活組織。生物組織的移植更昂貴，並具有更高的並發症風險。植入物在生物學上是惰性的，相對易於植入，這實際上是一件事情，但是您必須使用大量脂肪，因為並非所有脂肪都“服用”，並且可以說比植入物具有更大的並發症潛力。“隆胸”的Wikipedia頁面有一個非常大的部分，專門針對您應該檢查的方法。這是一件事情，使脂肪依賴脂肪，然後“雕刻”您的區域，然後將脂肪從脂肪中吸收，然後對脂肪進行消毒，然後將重新註射，但這次進入乳房。唯一的問題是，很多時候脂肪會被重新吸收，並且必須重新恢復過程。除非使用不當/使用插入設備進行不當或完全令人噁心的影響，否則不會影響乳房的結構以及如何儲存脂肪，胃/大腿脂肪在巴西的臀部升降機中使用
Why does the svartifoss waterfall cliff have squares,"It looks like [basalt pillars] erroded from the bottom. Basalt, due to the crystalline structure or something like that, naturally forms these shapes.According to the paragraph under the picture, they are hexagons, but I agree they look square. Anyway, if you use Ameoba's idea of the natural basalt crystals, plus that paragraph, which talks about repeated heat and cooling, it's a pretty good explanation.",為什麼Svartifoss瀑布懸崖有正方形,它看起來像[玄武岩柱]從底部轉移了。由於結晶的結構或類似的東西，玄武岩自然形成了這些形狀。根據圖片下的段落，它們是六角形的，但我同意它們看起來是正方形的。無論如何，如果您使用Ameoba對天然玄武岩晶體的想法，加上那段段落（談到重複的熱量和冷卻），這是一個很好的解釋。
How to catch up/develop a well informed opinion on world news and politics?,"Personally, I like Christian Science Monitor and The Economist. The BBC is also good for factual stories on world events.Not sure this is exactly the right subreddit to ask this question, but I would advise the most important thing is to read from a *variety* of sources. There are a number of places I personally get my news from, but you should also be aware of their political bent. The New York Times for an example, is great and all for US politics. It's very liberal, but a lot of world events gets plopped into ""World Briefing"" and don't get full articles. The Wall Street Journal has a conversative bent. They're similarly awesome and reputable to the NYT. The Economist is a great weekly British magazine. You can get a lot of non-US world news exposure there. Their articles are more obviously opinionated , but they're very well-written. Slate and The Nation are both really leftist. Everything's an opinion piece.Seconding what's already been said. Variety is key. - Christian Science Monitor has good international reporting, mainly because they still have bureaus where most other US newspapers have downsized . - I try to read both The Guardian and The Times of London to get a varied British perspective . BBC is good for getting quick headlines, but doesn't quite match up depth-wise. - Al-Jazeera catches flak from the Middle East for being anti-Arab and from the U.S. for being anti-American, but their coverage of the Arab Spring was better than anywhere else, so I read it pretty regularly.- Finally, if you're interested in military/defense and politics, [Small Wars Journal's daily Roundup] is a great source for quick headlines from a variety of sources.[The Atlantic] is very sophisticated yet unbiased. Especially the regular columnists.",如何趕上/對世界新聞和政治有一個知情的意見？,就我個人而言，我喜歡基督教科學監測儀和經濟學家。英國廣播公司（BBC）也適用於關於世界活動的事實故事。確定這是提出這個問題的正確選擇，但我建議最重要的是要從A *品種 *來源中閱讀。我個人來自許多地方，但您也應該意識到他們的政治傾向。紐約時報舉例來說是很棒的，對美國政治來說都是如此。這是非常自由的，但是許多世界活動都被陷入了“世界簡報”中，並且沒有完整的文章。《華爾街日報》有一個對話性彎曲。它們同樣令人敬畏，並且對紐約時裝差。這位經濟學家是一本很棒的英國雜誌。您可以在那裡獲得很多非美國世界新聞曝光。他們的文章更為明顯，但寫得很好。板岩和國家都是左派。一切都是輿論。再穩定地說了什麼。品種是關鍵。 - 基督教科學監測器的國際報導良好，主要是因為他們仍然擁有大多數美國報紙縮小規模的局局。 - 我嘗試閱讀《衛報》和《倫敦時報》，以獲得各種各樣的英國觀點。英國廣播公司（BBC）非常適合快速頭條新聞，但在深度方面並不完全匹配。-Al-Juazeera因反阿拉伯和美國而從中東捕捉到來自中東的Flak，但他們對阿拉伯之春的報導比其他任何地方都要好，所以我經常讀到。-最後，如果您“對軍事/國防和政治感興趣，[小戰爭雜誌的每日綜述]是來自各種來源的快速頭條新聞的重要來源。[大西洋]非常複雜但公正。特別是常規專欄作家。
The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two ""entities"", Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The borders between these two are more or less defined by the territory the opposing forces of the Bosnian war held. The two entities are mostly autonomous, but they are both represented internationally by the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina . There is one citizenship, and people are free to travel between the two entities. There is also the Brčko District which is an area which is shared by the two entities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is further split up into cantons which govern themselves to some degree.Well, BiH has 3 presidents, one for each ethnic group. The Dayton Accords really aims at equal, power sharing among Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and Muslims, but the framework created at Dayton has proven to be pretty divisive. Also, interestingly, the highest political power in the Bosnia is called the High Representative, also stipulated by the Dayton framework. The High Representative's job is to implement the peace plan, apparently. But the High Representative isn't actually representative of the Bosnian people as the job has only gone to diplomats and politicians from other countries, namely EU countries, and they don't have to answer to any elected official within Bosnia, itself.",波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那的政治結構,波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那包括兩個“實體”，斯普斯卡共和國以及波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那聯合會。這兩者之間的邊界或多或少由波斯尼亞戰爭的對立力量所束縛。這兩個實體主要是自主的，但它們在國際上都由波斯尼亞政府和黑塞哥維那代表。有一個公民身份，人們可以在兩個實體之間自由旅行。還有Brčko區，這是兩個實體共享的區域。波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那聯合會進一步分為在某種程度上管理自己的州。代頓協定確實旨在平等，波斯尼亞塞族人，克羅地亞人和穆斯林之間的權力共享，但代頓創造的框架已被證明是分裂的。同樣，有趣的是，波斯尼亞的最高政治權力被稱為高級代表，也被代頓框架規定。顯然，高級代表的工作是實施和平計劃。但是，高級代表實際上並不是波斯尼亞人民的代表，因為這項工作只歸於其他國家（即歐盟國家）的外交官和政客，他們不必向波斯尼亞內部的任何民選官員回答本身。

Tomatoes and peppers are native to the Americas. Why are they identified with traditional Italian/Indian/Chinese/etc food?,"A handful of centuries is an extremely long time. I wouldn't be surprised if the foods you mention almost completely supplanted traditional foods in Asia and Europe. Many New World crops offered vastly superior yields and nutritional value -- the introduction of potatoes to northern Europe caused an increase in available food which was followed by an increase in population which in turn necessitated the growing of more and more potatoes to feed the area's population. If I recall correctly the yam or possibly the sweet potato had the same effect in China. Regarding your original question, though; try Google or Wikipedia.",西紅柿和辣椒原產於美洲。為什麼他們可以用傳統的意大利/印度/中文/等食品來識別？,少數幾個世紀非常長。如果您提到的食物幾乎完全取代了亞洲和歐洲的傳統食品，我不會感到驚訝。許多新世界作物的產量和營養價值都非常出色 - 向北歐的土豆引入了可用食品的增加，隨後人口增加，這反過來又需要增加越來越多的土豆來養活該地區的人口。如果我沒記錯的話，山藥或可能在中國有相同的作用。關於您最初的問題；嘗試Google或Wikipedia。
Why are nike shoes $150 or more and how do they enhance performance in sports?,"It's a fashion statement mostly. Don't get me wrong - there's some technology and research there, but not nearly enough to really affect, well, anything that much. You may jump a few millimeters higher through some new bouncy sole and lighter material. And there is some stability enhancements that will slightly reduce the risk of a rolled ankle. And some fabric may allow the foot to ""breathe"" a hair better. But in the end, it's clever marketing.It's all just marketing. They can charge whatever the market will bear. As for performance; the best thing you can do is find pair of shoes that's comfortable at a price you can afford.",耐克鞋為什麼要$ 150或更多？如何提高運動表現？,這主要是時尚陳述。不要誤會我的意思 - 那裡有一些技術和研究，但幾乎不足以真正影響任何事情。通過一些新的彈力鞋底和更輕的材料，您可能會跳一些毫米。而且有一些穩定性的增強能力，可以稍微降低滾動腳踝的風險。一些織物可能會使腳更好地“呼吸”頭髮。但最後，這是聰明的營銷。這一切都是營銷。他們可以收取市場將承擔的一切。至於性能；您能做的最好的事情是找到一雙以您負擔得起的價格舒適的鞋子。
How all these big websites lately have been getting their data hacked.,"Properly securing websites is one of those things where if you're doing your job right, no one notices. If you're doing it wrong, no one notices until you get compromised. This is why it often doesn't get enough attention. In addition, because various sites are architected in many different ways in terms of software and topology, there's no one ""right way"" to secure things. Whereas there exist best practices for Wordpress blogs for example, time must be spent to determine where more complex systems are vulnerable. That doesn't excuse basic mistakes like not salting passwords or leaving database ports open, however. Some of the recent attacks are not technological, but rather are social engineering. If users are giving away their credentials, there's no foolproof solution.",最近，所有這些大網站最近如何將其數據入侵。,正確保護網站是如果您正確地完成工作，沒有人注意到。如果您做錯了，直到您被妥協之前，沒有人注意到。這就是為什麼它通常沒有得到足夠的關注的原因。此外，由於各種站點在軟件和拓撲方面都以許多不同的方式進行了架構，因此沒有一個“正確的方法”來保護事物。例如，對於WordPress博客而言，必須花費時間來確定更複雜的系統易受傷害的時間。但是，這並不能理會基本錯誤，例如不醃製密碼或將數據庫端口打開。最近的一些攻擊不是技術，而是社會工程學。如果用戶贈送了他們的憑據，則沒有萬無一失的解決方案。
why is depression so common in our species when the ultimate goal is to pass genes on? Isn't that counterproductive?,"Humans, because of the society we have made for ourselves, don't necessarily need to respond to environmental pressures genetically when it comes to passing on our genes. A person with clinical depression in our society can be treated and still have sex. It's not preventing genes from being passed on, and that's the question you always have to answer when you're thinking about why x wasn't ""fixed"" by evolution. If it doesn't prevent sex, you're not going to see any genetic fixes.",當最終目標是通過基因傳遞時，為什麼抑鬱症在我們的物種中如此普遍？那不是適得其反嗎？,人類，由於我們為自己創造的社會，在傳遞基因時，不一定需要對環境壓力做出遺傳壓力。我們社會中患有臨床抑鬱症的人可以受到治療，但仍會發生性關係。這並不能阻止基因傳遞，這是當您考慮為什麼X不是通過進化“固定”的問題時，您總是要回答的問題。如果不能防止性行為，您將不會看到任何遺傳修復。
"The ""Economic gap"" between the ""1%"" and the ""99%""","This is obviously a very complicated question, ~~Nobel Prize winning~~ economist Thomas Piketty set out to explore it in his book Capital. What it comes down to is this: If you make enough money to keep you alive, you will never get any richer. Every day you will earn $5 and at the end of the day you will have $0 left, and so the cycle repeats until you die. But if you earn $6, you can put away some of that money. You can save $1 a day and put it in a bank account. You can set the money to work, *to make you more money*. For the super-rich, this is even more extreme. The more money you make, the more you can invest, and the more you make off of those investments that you can then re-invest. It's a positive feedback loop.The top ""1%"" has a very America-centric vibe to it. It often means the 1% in countries that are wealthy, not the 1% for the world. If you earn more than $70,000/year congratulations you're a 1%er. One of the problems with the 0.1% is that they accumulate money but don't spend it. In economics with your surplus income you should invest it so that you can earn more. But a lot of these guys just sit on a giant pile of cash. Other 1%ers have similar behaviors, although not as extreme. I invest 15% of my income every year but 20-25% of it is just sitting in a rainy day savings account. Why this way of working is particularly bad for the economy is that it means less investment, less opportunities, less jobs, and less consumerism .One guy with a billion dollars doesn't spend money the same way as a million guys with a thousand dollars. The rich tend to keep each other richer. Not always on purpose, but just how the system is in regards to what money ends up where.",“ 1％”和“ 99％”之間的“經濟差距”,"這顯然是一個非常複雜的問題，~~諾貝爾獎獲得了~~經濟學家托馬斯·皮凱蒂（Thomas Piketty）開始在他的書本中探索它。歸結為這樣的是：如果您賺到足夠的錢來讓自己活著，那麼您將永遠不會變得更富有。每天您都會賺5美元，到一天結束時，您將剩下$ 0，因此循環重複直到您死亡。但是，如果您賺了6美元，則可以付出一些錢。您可以每天節省$ 1並將其放入銀行帳戶。您可以將錢設置為工作， *賺更多的錢 *。對於超級富裕的人來說，這更加極端。您賺錢的錢越多，投資越多，就越能從那些可以重新投資的投資中進行投資。這是一個積極的反饋循環。最高的“ 1％”具有非常以美國為中心的氛圍。這通常意味著有錢的國家中的1％，而不是世界上的1％。如果您賺取超過70,000美元/年的祝賀，您將獲得1％的急診室。0.1％的問題之一是他們積累了錢，但不要花錢。在您的盈餘收入的經濟學中，您應該投資於此，以便您可以賺更多。但是很多這些傢伙只是坐在一堆現金上。其他1％的人具有相似的行為，儘管不是那麼極端。我每年投資15％的收入，但其中20-25％只是坐在雨天的儲蓄帳戶中。為什麼這種工作方式對經濟特別不利，它意味著更少的投資，更少的機會，更少的就業機會和更少的消費主義。一個擁有十億美元的人的花費並不像一百萬美元的一百萬人一樣。富人傾向於使彼此更富有。並非總是故意的，而只是系統的最終收入。"
What would happen if you were quiet for years?,"The vocal folds are mucous membranes. Unlike muscles, which can atrophy and deteriorate from lack of use, using or not using the vocal cords doesn't really make a huge difference in their well-being. You might have some voice breaking or stammering when you try to speak again after a long time, but it's not like they would waste away from lack of use. I believe that the biggest impact from lack of speaking would be more psychological. If you're in a situation where you can manage to not speak for any reason, you probably will not have a lot of human contact, which can affect your mental health in various different ways.",如果您安靜多年會發生什麼？,聲帶是粘膜。與肌肉不同，這種肌肉會因缺乏使用而導致萎縮和惡化，或者不使用聲帶並沒有真正改變其幸福感。很長一段時間後，當您嘗試再次講話時，您可能會發出一些打破或結結巴巴的味道，但這並不是說他們會因為缺乏使用而浪費。我認為，缺乏說話的最大影響將更加心理上。如果您處於無法出於任何原因的情況下，您可能不會有很多人類聯繫，這可能會以各種不同的方式影響您的心理健康。
Can imaginary numbers be represented visually?,"One very helpful concept that helped me understand complex numbers is [this]. It makes a lot more sense when you think about it in the way described above. Real numbers lie on a real number line, going forward for positive numbers and going backward for negative numbers. But imaginary numbers force you to deviate off the real number line by rotating about the origin and going off in that directionEvery time you start with a number and multiple it by sqrt four times, you end up back where you started, but first you pass through the opposite of where you started. Right? This behavior is a lot like the circular motion you see from, say, the minutes-hand on a clock ever four quarters of an hour it is back where it started, but after two quarters of an hour it is on the opposite side of the clock. So imaginary numbers are useful for tracking circular motion.",想像中的數字可以視覺表示嗎？,一個非常有用的概念可以幫助我理解複雜的數字。當您以上述方式思考它時，這更有意義。實際數字位於實際數字線上，前進的正數並落後負數。但是虛構的數字迫使您通過旋轉來源並在這個方向上偏離實際數字線，從一個數字開始，然後由SQRT進行多次多次，您最終會回到啟動的位置，但首先您通過與您開始的位置相反。正確的？這種行為很像您看到的圓形運動，例如，一個小時四分之一小時的鐘錶上的鐘錶又回來了，但是經過兩個小時後，它就在鐘。因此，假想數對於跟踪循環運動很有用。
How do news outlets get a hold of all those secret tapes and documents that they reveal exclusively?,"These usually come from whistleblowers or people who leak the info. Some news organizations pay for stuff, like TMZ or the National Enquirer. Most media companies don't pay . Usually sources give this stuff freely for a couple of reasons: - They want to expose corruption.- They have an ax to grind against a person or organization. - They want some fame or notoriety.",新聞媒體如何掌握它們獨家揭示的所有秘密錄像帶和文件？,這些通常來自舉報人或洩露信息的人。一些新聞機構為TMZ或國家詢問者等付款。大多數媒體公司不付款。通常，消息來源以兩個原因自由提供這些東西： - 他們想揭露腐敗。-他們有一個斧頭與一個人或組織磨碎。 - 他們想要一些名望或臭名昭著。
The difference between race versus ethnicity.,"Simplistically and quite generally, race is what most people think of as one's physical form, and is based on outward appearance. Ethnicity is what most people think of as one's background, and is based on things like language, clothing, religious customs, etc. There are no hard lines between these designations, some overlap, and their definition is also very fluid, depending on the preconceptions and background of the observer themselves. Generally, when thinking of race, an observer will describe someone as being Black, or Asian, or White. This same observer might describe that persons ethnicity as being Jamaican, Vietnamese, or Polish. There are all sorts of problems with these kinds of artificial designations, the most important of which is that there really is no such thing as race]"" *per sé** race = biological, based on DNA* ethnicity = social, based on groups', ""I think /u/verticaljeff has it right. Race is usually broken down into a few big categories based on our development over thousands of years: caucasian, negroid and mongoloid were the races in old-school anthropology, but you could also group races as African, European, Native American, Asian, etc. Ethnicity would be a finer grouping based on culture and self-identification, like being Scottish instead of just being European. Scotland has a cultural history and identity, Europe doesn't . The lines really are blurry depending on the context. African-American and Black are largely interchangeable in the US, but the culture, history, and identity would really be better described with being African-American as Black could describe any number of cultures all over the world. The whole thing is really an artificial categorization so there's bound to be some wiggle room between the two.Race typically refers to the physical characteristics of a person, while ethnicity refers to the social/cultural group you identify with. They are not interchangeable, but sometimes seem that way because some race terms are also used as ethnic terms and vice-versa.

Why do we get so much satisfaction out of popping things?,"It's actually pretty simple. When we get surprised or something happens suddenly, our brains send blood and endorphins through our body. Popping something provides us with a ""controlled"" surprise where we know we are going to be surprised and we also know that we wont be harmed. So we get the benefits of being surprised without the risk.I think it's a cleansing thing we LOVE to pop pimples and blisters on our bodies. Everyone who enjoys /r/popping can back me up. Biologically it makes sense to expunge bacteria from our bodies, my guess is that feeling of relief appeals to our mirror neurons and somehow it also transfers to things like bubble wrap.",為什麼我們從彈出事物中獲得如此滿意？,實際上很簡單。當我們感到驚訝或突然發生某些事情時，我們的大腦會通過我們的身體向血液和內啡肽發出。彈出某些東西為我們提供了一個“受控”的驚喜，我們知道我們會感到驚訝，而且我們也知道我們不會受到傷害。因此，我們會感到驚訝而沒有風險。我認為這是我們喜歡在身體上彈出丘疹和水泡的清潔事情。每個喜歡 /r /poping的人都可以支持我。從生物學上講，從我們的身體中刪除細菌是有意義的，我的猜測是，這種救濟感吸引了我們的鏡像神經元，並以某種方式將其轉移到諸如泡泡包裹之類的東西上。

"Why do we, and all other animals, breath and use oxygen when nitrogen is so much more available in the atmosphere?","The nitrogen gas molecule is extremely stable and hard to crack apart. Most living organisms can't do it - most of the biological nitrogen in existence came from specialized bacteria. On the other hand, the oxygen gas molecule is highly reactive, meaning its energy can be harnessed for useful chemical reactions, like those that support life.",當氮在大氣中更可用時，為什麼我們以及所有其他動物都呼吸和使用氧氣？,氮氣分子非常穩定，很難裂開。大多數活生物都無法做到 - 大多數存在的生物氮都來自專門的細菌。另一方面，氧氣分子具有高反應性，這意味著可以利用其能量來用於有用的化學反應，例如支持壽命的能量。
What is it about potatoes that makes them go so well with so many different foods?,"Potatoes are have a relatively neutral flavor. This means they can take on the flavors of other foods without greatly disrupting the flavor profile. They're also cheap way to add bulk and calories to a meal. Recall that calories are only a bad thing in societies and ages of affluence. In times and places where food is scarce, the goal is to get as many calories as you can into a meal because you don't know whether you're going to eat well next time. Even though we may not have such problems in some places today, it's still why the potato became an integral part of various cuisines in the first place.Watch this short informational video about potatoes, it will clear everything right up.

Why do most song lengths seem to fall between 2 and 4 minutes?,"Much of the answer has to do with the length limitations of vinyl 7"" 45 rpm singles, which for many years were the primary means of promoting a single song. You can only fit about 3 minutes of music onto a 45 rpm single. So historically, if you wanted to write a hit pop song, you had to keep it under that length. More here: [Why Are Songs On The Radio About The Same Length?][Billy Joel explains it in The Entertainer] > ""It was a beautiful song, / but it ran too long / If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit / So they cut it down to 3:05.""Top 10 charts have a lot to do with it. If you have 10 songs at 3 minutes each, you can get them all into a 30 minute radio segmentIt has to do with which kind of music you're talking about, and how it came to be. Most modern music is influenced by the radio station format, where it's convenient to have songs that span between 3 to 4 minutes tops. You'll even find ""radio edits"" of longer songs.There is also the format: early vinyl records were 10 inches in diameter and held only 3 minutes. Jukeboxes play 45 rpm records, and they span 3 minutes. So artists/record companies made songs that fit that length. If you look at classic music instead, you'll that symphonies are way longer than 3 minutes. Some of it was created for theater plays, or just orchestra. Since people would go to a venue and sit down to listen, lengthy pieces were expected. In less popular modern music timings vary a lot too. Most of these artists are not concerned with radio play, so they just do whatever they want, or what the genre they play expects of them.So you can find super short songs: _URL_3_Or really lengthy ones: _URL_2_ In short, length depends on the purpose of the music, the format, its audience, etc.",為什麼大多數歌曲長度似乎落在2到4分鐘之間？,答案的大部分與乙烯基7“ 45 rpm單打的長度限制有關，這是多年來宣傳一首歌的主要手段。您只能將大約3分鐘的音樂適應45 rpm的單打。，如果您想寫一首熱門流行歌曲，則必須將其保留在這段時間內。更多：[為什麼廣播中的歌曲大約相同？] [Billy Joel在藝人中解釋了它]優美的歌曲， /但是它運行時間太長 /如果您要打球，就必須使它適合 /這樣，他們將其降低到3:05。每張3分鐘的10首歌曲，您可以將它們全部帶入30分鐘的廣播節目中，與您在談論哪種音樂以及如何發生。大多數現代音樂受到廣播電台格式的影響，在很方便的地方，有跨越3到4分鐘頂部的歌曲很方便。您甚至會發現更長的歌曲的“無線電編輯”。這也是一種格式：早期的乙烯基唱片直徑為10英寸，只有3分鐘。自動點唱機播放45 rpm記錄，它們跨越了3分鐘。因此，藝術家/唱片公司製作的歌曲適合這一長度。如果您看經典音樂，那麼交響曲將超過3分鐘。其中一些是為劇院演出或只是樂團而創建的。由於人們會去場地坐下來聆聽，因此預計會有漫長的作品。在不太受歡迎的現代音樂時機也有很大差異。這些藝術家中的大多數都不關心廣播遊戲，因此他們只是做任何他們想做的事情，或者他們扮演的類型對它們的期望。因此，您可以找到超級短歌曲：_url_3_or確實很漫長：_url_2_簡短，長度取決於該歌曲音樂的目的，格式，觀眾等
Why is Kim Davis being held in contempt of court instead of just being fired for insubordination?,"tl;dr: Elected officials cannot be fired - they must resign or they must be removed from office through impeachment proceedings. Kim Davis is an elected official. So she cannot be ""fired."" There are two ways that she can be removed from office - by impeachment and by resignation. In the same way, President Obama cannot be ""fired."" He can be impeached by the Senate or he can resign from office. An interesting wrinkle is that the legislature in Kentucky does not meet throughout the year . So the legislature would need to call a special session to remove her from office through impeachment proceedings . Kim Davis is being held in contempt because she has refused to comply with an order issued by a judge. She can comply by resigning, being impeached, or deciding to do her job in compliance with the Constitution She's an elected official.

What is that falling feeling you get in your stomach when you go down a hill in a car or rollercoaster,"Did you ever jump into a cool swimming pool or river or something, and notice after five minutes or so that it's no longer cold? That's because your body 'gets used' to things after a bit. Your body is used to gravity . So you don't even notice that your insides and the content of your insides, are all under one gee of gravity, because it's always been that way. But get on that roller coaster and you're exposed to sometimes-more, sometimes-less gees of gravity that make your innards heavier or lighter, as well as anything in them. So you have upward pressure in your belly region and throat and their content when you round the crest of a big hill at speed, and downward pressure when you hit that curve at the bottom. And the best your brain can translate that to is a falling feeling.Im no proffessional, but I do remmeber reading about this once .

Why is the sea made out of salt water?,"Almost all natural water contains salts and other minerals including rivers and sweet water lakes just in different levels. Rivers flow constantly so the salt they pick up from the ground does not have time to build up to the point where it tastes salty.

During those millions of years, the sea has been evaporated be the sun and has rained and the land many times over. But every time it rains on the land, it picks up tiny pieces of rock and gunk called minerals. These minerals then wash into the sea with the rain. But when the sea evaporates, the minerals are left behind, and only the water leaves, and then more and more minerals are washed in by the rain. Now over the millions and millions of years that this has happened over and over, most of these minerals have either just fallen out of the water onto the sea floor, or they've been used by sea plants and animals to grow. Most of what's left behind is salt, like the salt that you put on your food. This is why the sea tastes salty.Basically because rivers all have lower amounts of salt in them, which they bring to the sea.

Someone dies before they get a chance to retire. What happens to all of their social security benefits?,"US Social Security works less like a piggy bank, and more like a Ponzi Scheme . Unlike most pension plans, citizens do not have individual ""Social security accounts"" which they pay into while they're working, and later withdraw from when they're retired.

When a citizen retires, they're not supported by the money paid in by their *own* generation, but by the generations which are currently working.

"Why does Bayern Munchen/Munich have the 2 names, and which one is ""correct""?","Its official German name is ""Fußball-Club Bayern, München e.V."", normally abbreviated to ""FC Bayern München"" or just ""Bayern München"". ""München"" is the name of the city -- its German name. To English-speaking people, the city is better known as ""Munich"", so in English-speaking countries the club is known as ""Bayern Munich"". That's not its official name, but the English version of the abbreviation of its official name. Of course, ""Bayern"" is German for ""Bavaria"", so you might expect the English name to be ""Bavaria Munich"". But English-speakers have no problem pronouncing ""Bayern"", so it's left as it is. ""München"", on the other hand, is really difficult for English-speakers: the sound written ""ch"" does technically exist in most English dialects but never in the middle of a word like this; while the sound written ""ü"" doesn't exist in English at all. As a result, English-speakers simply can't pronounce ""München"" correctly. If you're in any doubt as to the ""correct"" form, just look at [their logo] on their [official website].

Where do TV ratings come from?,"The main ratings firm is the Nielsen Company. Hence the term Nielsen ratings. This works basically the same way a political poll works.

They pick a sample the same way pollsters do. In this case people sign up to be ""Nielsen families"" and they're given a diary. They're supposed to track when someone is watching TV and what they're watching, and then report that information back to the Nielsen Company, who figures out how many of their sample are watching a show and then work out how many people that compares to across the whole country using a lot of statistics and math. One problem with this method is that it relies on the families to tell the truth, and sometimes they don't. Nielsen also uses electronic monitors that track what channel the TV is tuned to, and even has experimented with cameras that would confirm whether the TV's just on in an empty room or whether there are actually people in there watching it.",電視收視率從何而來？,主要評級公司是尼爾森公司。因此，尼爾森評級一詞。這基本上與政治民意調查的方式相同。有統計方法來研究少數人回答問題的方式，並弄清楚整個人群將如何回答這個問題。就像他們不必問 *所有人 *他們要投票的人，以弄清奧巴馬總統的民意調查，而米特·羅姆尼（Mitt Romney）的民意調查為y％，他們不必計算每個人看著一個人節目說很多人看了看它。他們以民意調查員的方式選擇了一個樣本。在這種情況下，人們註冊為“尼爾森家庭”，並給了他們日記。他們應該跟踪某人看電視和他們正在看電視的時間，然後將這些信息報告回尼爾森公司，尼爾森公司弄清楚了他們的樣本中有多少個正在觀看節目，然後弄清楚有多少人比較了在整個國家使用大量統計和數學。這種方法的一個問題是，它依靠家庭說實話，有時他們沒有。尼爾森還使用電子監視器來跟踪電視調整的頻道，甚至嘗試了相機，這些相機將確認電視是否僅在空房間中，或者是否真的在那裡看電視。

Bush vs Al Gore),"It was an extremely close race, the deciding state being Florida. 537 more Floridians voted for Bush than for Gore, but across the board, in the entire country, Gore got more of the popular vote. So the supreme court made the decision that since Bush won Florida, the deciding state, by a margin of 537 votes, that Bush had won the presidency. Somebody Correct me if I'm wrong please.",圍繞2000年選舉的爭議（喬治·W·布什與戈爾）,這是一場非常親密的比賽，決定性國家是佛羅里達州。537佛羅里達人投票支持布什，而不是戈爾，但全國各地的戈爾獲得了更多的選票。因此，最高法院決定以來，布什以537票的優勢贏得了佛羅里達州以來，布什贏得了總統職位。如果我錯了，請有人糾正我。
What's the difference between a flash drive and external hard drive?,"An external hard disk is called as such because it utilizes a Hard Disk Drive . One of these drives has a metal platter with different magnetic sections, called sectors, that are read by a small magnetic sensor called a head on the end of an actuator arm. Many people are now moving over to flash storage, however, which is what a flash drive utilizes and thus is named for. Flash storage does not contain moving parts but rather is similar to a large grid of capacitors and transistors that are used to keep data. It is faster to access than an HDD because you do not need to wait for the disk to spin to the correct location. It can decay, however, unlike an HDD. The more an area of flash is written the more it wears out and eventually it will fail.To add onto the other comments, hard drives are mechanical, so they are very sensitive to physical abuse, especially if they're running at the time. Drop a spinning hard drive, and the heads slam into the disk, destroying both instantaneously. Lights out for your precious data. You can drop and shake an SSD all day long even while it's running full steam ahead, and it simply won't care because there are no moving parts to get damaged. Also, since they're mechanical, HDDs can also wear out over time. However, at the end of life, hard drives still win. When a hard drive dies of old age or suffers an electronic as opposed to a mechanical failure, the data can still be recovered professionally as long as the disks inside are intact. An SSD, however, is pretty much impossible to retrieve data off of once it dies.You can now get external flash drives. A traditional hard drive has a disk similar to a CD but is made to an industry standard. A flash drive is like a USB stick which is a solid state and means no time wasted spinning the disk loading the info.",閃存驅動器和外部硬盤驅動器有什麼區別？,外部硬盤之所以稱為，是因為它使用了硬盤驅動器。這些驅動器之一的金屬盤子具有不同的磁性截面，稱為扇形，該磁扇形由一個小的磁性傳感器讀取，稱為執行器臂末端的小磁性傳感器。但是，許多人現在正在轉向閃存存儲，但是，這是Flash Drive使用的，因此是命名的。閃存存儲不包含運動零件，而是類似於用於保留數據的大型電容器和晶體管網格。它比HDD更快，因為您不需要等待磁盤旋轉到正確的位置。但是，它可能會衰減與HDD不同。寫的閃光區域越多，它的磨損越多，最終將失敗。要添加到其他評論中，硬盤驅動器是機械的，因此它們對身體虐待非常敏感，尤其是當他們當時運行時。放下一個旋轉的硬盤驅動器，頭部猛撞到磁盤中，立即摧毀兩者。照明您的寶貴數據。即使前方充滿了蒸汽，您也可以整天掉落並搖晃SSD，而且它根本不在乎，因為沒有活動部件可以損壞。另外，由於它們是機械性的，因此HDD也可以隨著時間的流逝而磨損。但是，在生命的盡頭，硬盤驅動器仍然獲勝。當硬盤驅動器死亡或遭受電子功能而不是機械故障而遭受電子驅動器時，只要內部磁盤完好無損，數據仍然可以在專業上恢復。但是，一旦死亡，SSD幾乎是不可能從數據中檢索的。您現在可以獲得外部閃存驅動器。傳統的硬盤驅動器具有類似於CD的磁盤，但符合行業標準。閃存驅動器就像一個USB棒，它是一個固態，意味著不會浪費時間旋轉磁盤加載信息。
Why are colleges and universities so different from each other (Yale vs a local community college) but all of the information taught in school is the same for their respected fields ?,"I studied physics at a reasonably high-ranked school, and I can tell you definitively that 90% of what I learned that actually stuck was from working with other students, not from lectures. The caliber of fellow students is hugely important in my opinion, and you simply get better students at better schools. I also contest your statement that the information taught is the same. With better professors and better students, more can be covered in the same amount of time, so subjects can be taught more completely and more thoroughly.I didn't go to Yale, but I did go to a reasonably good private university after a few semesters at a community college. In my experience, the quality of the instruction is hugely better at the private school. Professors actually seem to care about their students' progress, and they are just better at presenting the material in ways that the students can understand. I also noticed, even at my comparatively middle-brow university, that the caliber of the students was better. They catch on more quickly, have more interesting thought processes, and help each other rather than dragging each other down. Because the students are more engaged and quicker, the professors are more able to teach, and the classes go faster and cover more ground, more deeply. Let us not forget the administration, which is also leaps and bounds ahead in the private school. It's not just fill in the form and take a number, it's actually possible to get good, thoughtful answers from people. When I needed to talk to an advisor, it was easy and friendly to set up an appointment. When I emailed abstruse questions to the Registrar, I got thoughtful responses very quickly. TL;DR: Everything about private schools is just of higher quality and done better.",為什麼大學和大學彼此之間如此不同（耶魯大學與當地的社區學院），但是在學校教授的所有信息都對其受人尊敬的領域都是相同的？,我在一所相當高的學校學習了物理學，我可以確定地告訴您，我學到的實際上所學的90％是與其他學生合作而不是來自講座的工作。在我看來，同學的才能非常重要，您只是在更好的學校中得到更好的學生。我還質疑您的聲明，即所教的信息是相同的。有了更好的教授和更好的學生，可以在相同的時間內涵蓋更多的人，因此可以更徹底，更徹底地教授主題。我沒有去耶魯社區學院的學期。以我的經驗，私立學校的教學質量要好得多。教授們實際上似乎在乎學生的進步，他們會以學生能夠理解的方式呈現材料。我還注意到，即使在我相對較中的大學中，學生的才能也更好。他們更快地抓住了，擁有更有趣的思考過程，互相幫助，而不是互相拖動。由於學生的參與度更高，教授更有能力教學，而且課程更快，更深入地覆蓋地面。讓我們不要忘記政府，這也是私立學校的飛躍。這不僅是填寫表格並採用數字，而且實際上有可能從人們那裡獲得良好的周到答案。當我需要與顧問交談時，設置約會很容易且友好。當我通過電子郵件將“ Abstruse問題”發送給註冊商時，我很快就會得到周到的回答。TL; DR：關於私立學校的一切都具有更高的質量，並且做得更好。

Do News sites still see that I watched their video even if I said screw this when the Ad came up?,"If the video loads even for an instant, yes - that counts as a view. It does not technically count as a complete view if you left before the video ends, however, a view in the internet world is counted as an impression. They will also know if you left before the actual video by tallying up the number of times the ad and the actual video has been viewed . If the number of ad impressions exceeds the number of views, they will know that their ads suck and they need to put it elsewhere 'cause people are not seeing the actual content.In the case of YouTube, they actually take good notes of how much percentage you watched a video, this goes into the algorithm of the search engine in order to promote videos that are fully watched.",新聞網站是否仍然看到我看過他們的視頻，即使我在廣告出現時說了這件事？,如果視頻甚至可以立即加載，是的，這是一種視圖。如果您在視頻結束之前離開，從技術上講，它並不是一個完整的視圖，但是，互聯網世界中的視圖被視為一種印象。他們還將知道您是否通過查看廣告的數量和實際視頻的次數來知道您是否離開了實際視頻。如果廣告印象的數量超過了視圖數量，他們會知道他們的廣告很爛，需要將其放在其他地方，因為人們沒有看到實際內容。在YouTube的情況下，他們實際上記下了多少您觀看了視頻的百分比，這進入了搜索引擎的算法，以宣傳完全觀看的視頻。
Black athletes with hyphenated names,"No I meant why is it so prevalent in black athletes. I know about hyphenated names with divorced parents. I want to know why it seems to only occur in black athletes and not in other races IN SPORTSHyphenated names=parents, for whatever reason, who don't share a surname. But saying it's ""black athletes"" is ignorant. It's actually pretty common in the general population as marriage becomes less a focus for couples raising kids or men not requiring their wife to take their name for some ideological reason.Not sure what you mean, do you mean when people hyphen their last names of their separated parents? If so, it's because they love their parents, so they take both their names.",帶有連字符的黑人運動員,不，我的意思是為什麼黑人運動員如此普遍。我知道與離婚父母的連字符。我想知道為什麼它似乎僅在黑人運動員中發生，而在其他種族中不出現在運動型名稱中=父母，無論出於何種原因，他們都不共享姓氏。但是說這是“黑人運動員”是無知的。實際上，在普通人群中，這實際上很普遍，因為婚姻成為夫妻撫養孩子或不需要妻子出於某種意識形態原因而姓名的焦點。不確定您的意思是什麼，當人們連字符的姓氏時，您是什麼意思分居的父母？如果是這樣，那是因為他們愛父母，所以他們都拿下了他們的名字。
Why do I get a feeling someone's watching me even when I can't see them?,"I've always heard that the brain records and processes every single thing your eyes see. EVERYTHING. Although it sees all, it has to choose what information it presents to your aware mind at the moment in time. Although your brain saw everything when you walked into a new room, there is only certain information that you need to be aware of, and only a certain amount of information you can actually use. My best guess is you can sense someone is watching you because at some point in the last few minutes your brain actually saw someone but you just werent aware of it at the time. But because the brain is wired for survival it tries to send messages to you that you should be careful, hence the feeling of being watched. Thats the way i understand it.",為什麼即使看不見他們，我也會感覺到有人在看我？,我一直聽說大腦記錄和處理您的眼睛看到的每一件事。一切。儘管它看到了一切，但它必須選擇它在時間的時候向您的頭腦中提供的信息。儘管您走進新房間時，您的大腦看到了一切，但只有您需要了解的某些信息，只有一定數量的信息您實際上可以使用。我最好的猜測是，您可以感覺到有人在看著您，因為在過去的幾分鐘中，您的大腦實際上看到了某人，但您只是在當時意識到它。但是，由於大腦的生存有線，因此試圖向您發送信息，您應該小心，因此被觀察的感覺。那就是我理解的方式。
"what is ""old man"" strength?","Nobody's mentioned this, so I figured I'd give my $0.02. Old man strength is typically from those who have been performing some form of physical labor for a long time, and have such developed incredible grip strength.

Why is a mouse more accurate than a joystick on a controller,"Because with a computer mouse you move it exactly X distance on the table so the cursor moves Y distance. With a joystick, you essentially 'toggle' the cursors movement in any given direction, for a certain length of time, until the cursor reaches what you need. It's also less accurate because you're dealing with a fixed joystick instead of a mouse that you can move all the way across your desk if you wanted to. This is my interpretation of it, anyway"", 'Because a movement on a joystick applies ""velocity"" but movement on a mouse applies a position change. Think about it, you move a joystick to the left, it will keep going left even though your hand is not moving anything, just keeping the joystick on the left side. A mouse on the other hand requires movement to apply this change, stopping this movement will stop this movement. This is simply something more natural and understood to humansMouse moves by pixels. That is using a camera it counts them. Joysticks move by binary off and on multiplying by sensitivity so the smallest move can never be a single pixel.",為什麼鼠標比控制器上的操縱桿更準確,因為使用計算機鼠標，您可以將其精確地移動x距離，以便光標移動y距離。使用操縱桿，您本質上可以在任何給定的方向上“切換”光標運動，直到光標達到所需的時間為止。它也不太準確，因為您正在處理固定的操縱桿而不是鼠標，如果願意，您可以一路移動到桌子上。無論如何，這都是我對此的解釋。'，因為操縱桿上的運動應用了“速度”，但是鼠標上的運動應用了位置變化。想一想，您將操縱桿向左移動，即使它仍會繼續前進，即使您的手沒有移動任何東西，只是將操縱桿保持在左側。另一方面，鼠標需要運動進行這種更改，停止這種動作將阻止這種動作。這只是更自然的東西，並且可以理解為像素的人類動作。這是在使用相機，它計算它們。操縱桿通過二進制移動並乘以靈敏度而乘以乘以，因此最小的移動永遠不會是一個像素。
When was the last time in human history it would be more common to see someone walking barefoot than with shoes or sandals?,"It was common up until the 1950s in the south for children to go without shoes. It is still somewhat common in regions with lots of creeks.Right now, in a whole lot of poorer places. A good friend of mine didn't have shoes until she was 16 because her family couldn't afford them.It depends on where you are in the world. Sandals or barefoot is still very common in most tropical areas year round.",人類歷史上的最後一次是什麼時候赤腳走路比穿鞋或涼鞋更常見？,直到1950年代在南部，這是很普遍的，讓孩子們不鞋子去。在很多小溪的地區，它仍然有些普遍。現在，在許多貧窮的地方。我的一個好朋友直到16歲，因為她的家人負擔不起，這取決於您在世界上的位置。在全年的大多數熱帶地區，涼鞋或赤腳仍然很普遍。
Why do some drinks seem to pass right through you whereas plain water is retained?,"The sugar and electrolytes in Gatorade and other sports drinks actually increase how much water you absorb into your blood stream. This can be perceived as too much fluid and your body will try to get rid of it if you aren't actually dehydrated. Normal water, on the other hand, lacks the sugar and electrolytes that promote water absorption so it stays around in your gut longer.",為什麼有些飲料似乎可以通過您，而純淨水則保留？,佳得樂（Gatorade）和其他運動飲料中的糖和電解質實際上增加了您吸收的水量。這可以被認為是過多的液體，如果您實際上沒有脫水，您的身體將嘗試擺脫它。另一方面，普通水缺乏促進吸水的糖和電解質，因此它在腸道中停留的時間更長。
How does a disease make a comeback like Ebola or the Bubonic plague have recently?,"Ebola has no cure, or even a real treatment. It never really went away. It's just that humans aren't commonly exposed to it , and when they are it tends to kill quickly enough that it burns itself out. So you see a series of fairly quick and nasty outbreaks in the areas in which infected bat populations come in contact with humans, in west and central Africa. Plague is different, in that it's curable with antibiotics. It lives in various rodents, and occasionally breaks out because it too has never really gone away. If it happens in a richer country, it's usually dealt with pretty easily. Isolated cases pop up in the US and Canada now and again, incidentally.",疾病如何使像埃博拉病毒或泡沫瘟疫這樣的複出？,埃博拉病毒無法治愈，甚至是真正的治療方法。它從未真正消失。只是人類通常不會暴露於它，而當它們是人類時，它往往會迅速殺死以使其自身燃燒。因此，您會在受感染的蝙蝠種群與西非和中非的人類接觸的地區看到一系列相當快速，令人討厭的爆發。瘟疫是不同的，因為它可以用抗生素治愈。它生活在各種囓齒動物中，偶爾會爆發，因為它也從未真正消失。如果發生在一個富裕國家，通常很容易處理。偶然地在美國和加拿大出現的孤立案件。

"What would happen if there was absolutely no US involvement (i.e. provision of weapons, logistics, drones, etc) in the Middle East?","the IS would take over. creating a bigger ""nation"" that's hostile towards US relations. puts israel and our trade partners in the middle east at risk. a middle of the road country is open to trade as long as such a trade agreement does't cause problems with its neighbor. if ISIS is their neighbor, they're less open to agreeing to trade with the enemy of ISIS.",如果中東絕對沒有美國參與（即提供武器，物流，無人機等），該怎麼辦？,IS將接管。建立一個對美國關係敵對的更大的“國家”。將以色列和我們在中東的貿易夥伴處於危險之中。只要這樣的貿易協定不會與鄰居造成問題，道路國家的中間是開放的。如果ISIS是他們的鄰居，那麼他們不太願意同意與ISIS的敵人進行交易。
"What does the ""strength"" of an earthquake acutally mean?","As you may know, an earthquake occurs when two slabs of rock move relative to one another over a surface called a ""fault"". Moment magnitude is simply the product of the area of the fault ruptured, the relative movement across the fault, and the stiffness of the rock . It is closely related to the energy released in the earthquake, but the relation is not trivial. The moment magnitude does not take into account any other factors, so ignores the depth, duration, size of area affected, and so on. The moment magnitude is an important quantity in academia because it is directly related to the fault rupture itself. However, it is not of huge benefit for working out impacts because other parameters like proximity to population centres, building quality, depth and surface geology are a lot more important than the moment magnitude. You may be interested in the USGS's [PAGER program] which tries to take these factors into account to estimate the economic and humanitarian impact of earthquakes when they happen.",地震的“力量”實際上是什麼意思？,如您所知，當兩個岩石板相對在一個稱為“故障”的表面上移動時，就會發生地震。力矩幅度僅僅是斷層破裂區域的乘積，跨斷層的相對運動以及岩石的剛度。它與地震中釋放的能量密切相關，但關係並不是微不足道的。力矩幅度沒有考慮到任何其他因素，因此忽略了受影響的深度，持續時間，面積的大小等。力矩幅度是學術界的重要數量，因為它與斷層破裂本身直接相關。但是，鍛煉影響並不是巨大的好處，因為其他參數（例如靠近人口中心，建築質量，深度和地面地質）比瞬間幅度重要得多。您可能對USGS的[Pager計劃]感興趣，該計劃試圖考慮這些因素以估算地震發生時對經濟和人道主義的影響。
How does the air-pressure sensor in rotating car tires report the pressure to the stationary chassis?,"There are direct and indirect systems. Direct systems have some sort of sensor in the tires that measure the air pressure, and use wireless communications to feed that data to the car's computer. Indirect systems don't measure the pressure directly, but sensors on the rest of the car measure different variables on how the car is riding, and then a computer on the car tries to interpolate tire pressure. Generally the car has to be driven for a little while and it creates a sort of baseline profile of how the car rides. Over time, if the sensors measure significant changes from that baseline, then that's a clue that something might be up with the tires. Direct systems are much more accurate, but require sensors ) to be located in each tire, which can be a significant maintenance issue. The indirect systems can't give you an actual measurement of pressure in each tire, but can usually detect when a tire gets low enough to be a serious issue.",旋轉汽車輪胎中的空氣壓力傳感器如何向固定機箱報告壓力？,有直接和間接的系統。直接系統在輪胎中具有某種傳感器，可以測量氣壓，並使用無線通信將數據饋送到汽車的計算機中。間接系統不會直接測量壓力，但是汽車其餘部分的傳感器測量了有關汽車騎行方式的不同變量，然後汽車上的計算機試圖插入輪胎壓力。通常，汽車必須驅動一會兒，並且會產生一種關於汽車騎行方式的基線概況。隨著時間的流逝，如果傳感器測量了該基線的重大變化，那麼這是一個線索，可能會出現輪胎。直接系統要精確得多，但需要傳感器）位於每個輪胎中，這可能是一個重大的維護問題。間接系統不能為您在每個輪胎中的壓力進行實際測量，但通常可以檢測到輪胎何時變得足夠低以成為一個嚴重的問題。

But this probe was launched 10 years ago, and was designed and built mostly during the 90s.To put it simply, more megapixels = higher resolution = larger filesize = more 1s/0s. I'm not sure about the data transfer rate between the probe and Earth, but I'm assuming that it's not a quick process. The lower resolution image probably took a little while to send, therefore a higher resolution image will take a significantly longer time to send.",我們怎麼能在彗星上降落探針並在銀河系周圍發送衛星，但是我們不能在這些設備上放置高分辨率的彩色攝像頭？,我們現在可以。但是該探針是10年前推出的，主要是在90中設計和建造的。簡單地說，更多百萬像素=更高分辨率=較大的filesize =更多1s/0s。我不確定探針和地球之間的數據傳輸速率，但我假設這不是一個快速的過程。較低的分辨率圖像可能需要一段時間才能發送，因此更高的分辨率圖像將需要更長的時間來發送。
Why some credit card transactions require a billing address and some only require a zipcode?,"CVV codes are not mandatory, it is up to the person/company as to whether or not they want to require it or not. In some cases their Merchant provider will offer cheaper rates on transaction when CVV is used, as it leads to less fraud however some retailers choose not to do that. Many merchants still refuse to include a security code field in their online checkout forms, because they believe that doing so may confuse some of their customers or otherwise put them off and lead to lost sales. It's also a violation of PCI compliance to store CVV numbers, which helps reduce fraud but since the CVV can't be stored it means that the buyer has to have their card with them at time of purchase , but some companies do believe that can hurt sales.",為什麼有些信用卡交易需要帳單地址，而有些則只需要ZipCode？,CVV代碼不是強制性的，這取決於人員/公司是否需要要求。在某些情況下，使用CVV時，他們的商人提供商會提供更便宜的交易利率，因為它會導致欺詐較少，但是一些零售商選擇不這樣做。許多商人仍然拒絕在其在線結帳表中包含安全代碼字段，因為他們認為這樣做可能會使某些客戶感到困惑或否則將其推遲並導致銷售損失。這也違反了PCI遵守庫存CVV數字，這有助於減少欺詐行為，但由於CVV無法存儲，這意味著買家必須在購買時與他們一起使用卡，但是有些公司確實認為這會受到傷害銷售量。

We water down the black in different amounts or whatever colors and just like water color painting we blend in the shading/colors. White is not the proper way to do a greyscale tattoo. White is meant for accenting and highlighting. Multiple needles at different sizes are also key to this process with the right amount of voltage and speed, and plenty of lubrication for the skin to not be damaged.",梯度如何在紋身中起作用,嗨，我紋身，這正是他們所說的。這些針不需要穿透太深，而您越過它的次數越多，您想從最輕到黑暗就變得越暗。你不能把黑暗倒退。我們以不同的量或任何顏色澆水，就像我們以陰影/顏色融合的水顏色油漆一樣。白色不是做灰度紋身的正確方法。白色是為了強調和突出。具有適量的電壓和速度的多個針頭也是該過程的關鍵，並且要潤滑大量潤滑，以免受損。
How did the russian revolution start?,"The Russian Revolution is actually two revolutions, the February revolution and the October revolution . During World War 1, in February 1917, a bunch of workers in Russia started a strike, and basically everybody ended up joining it, including the army and eventually some key figures of the Czar's government. They forced the Czar to step down and give power to the Provisional Government, that was supposed to organize free elections, but ended up being removed from power in November by a group of Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin and Trotsky. The basic reasons were that the Russians were losing WW1, and that there was a lot of poverty and hunger. Also, the Czar was very unpopular because he taxed heavily and was very dictatorial. It turned out that the Provisional Government really didn't do that much better, so that gave Lenin the chance he took to get some support for this second revolution.",俄羅斯革命是如何開始的？,俄羅斯革命實際上是兩輪革命，即2月革命和十月革命。在第一次世界大戰期間，1917年2月，一群俄羅斯的工人開始罷工，基本上每個人最終都加入了它，包括軍隊，最終是沙皇政府的一些關鍵人物。他們迫使沙皇辭職，並向臨時政府施加權力，該政府本來可以組織自由選舉，但最終由列寧和托洛茨基領導的一群布爾什維克在11月被一群布爾什維克撤職。基本原因是俄羅斯人失去了第一次世界大戰，並且有很多貧窮和飢餓。另外，沙皇非常不受歡迎，因為他對大量徵稅，非常獨裁。事實證明，臨時政府確實沒有做得更好，因此這給了列寧，他有機會獲得第二次革命的支持。
How do the water intake on this nuclear plant work? And how this guy managed to go from the inlet to the outlet without a scratch?,"Nuclear engineer here. He was sucked from he ocean to the intake bay. At the far end of the intake bay is where the pumps push water through the plant. The intake bay water level is at a slightly lower elevation than the ocean, which created the pressure that sucked him through. He didn't pass through any pumps or the plant, just an intake pump to the bay.The inlet leads to a holding pond below sea level, the water in the pipe he entered was flowing due to gravity alone. The water is pumped from the holding pond maintaining the lower level. That pond is where the diver was foundI am just offering my wild ass guess, but maybe just pressure from the pipes being lower than the outlet mixed with temperature differential?",該核電站的攝入量如何？這個傢伙如何在沒有划痕的情況下從入口到出口？,核工程師在這裡。他被從海洋吸走到進氣灣。在進氣艙的遠端，泵將水通過植物推。進氣灣水位的海拔比海洋略低，這造成了使他陷入困境的壓力。他沒有穿過任何泵或植物，只有一個進氣泵到達海灣。入口導致海拔以下的一個池塘，他進入的管道中的水僅由於重力而流動。水是從保持較低層的儲藏池中抽水的。那個池塘是潛水員的基礎，只是在提供我的野性屁股猜測，但也許只是管道的壓力低於與溫度差異混合的出口的壓力？
How do the mammals of the ocean hydrate themselves.,"They have awesome kidneys. The kidneys are able to filter the water to hydrate the body and remove the salt. Human kidneys are not so awesome.Their skin really locks water in well. They have physical mechanisms to desalinate water during ingestion. They get a fair amount of water from the food they eat without drinking seawater. And their kidneys are very efficient. Lets say that you or I drank some seawater. We drink 12oz of seawater at normal salinity. Ahh it's sour but refreshing when you're stranded in a life raft. Our bodies absorb the water just like normal, woo hoo this was a good idea!! But we also absorb the salt, and we then have to get rid of the salt. That is the job of the kidneys, however the kidneys don't have a conveyor belt. There is no kidney car that drives waste products from the kidneys to your bladder. The kidneys ironically need water in order to flush the salt out of your body. The problem is that the amount of water they need is more than the amount of water you got from drinking 12oz of seawater. So you are temporarily refreshed, but you suffer a net loss of water, which is sucked out of your blood, organs, muscles, and tissues. Okay so you're thirstier, so you drink more, same thing happens, now your tongue starts to darken, you start getting the shakes and vomiting, losing even more precious water, now you're on the downhill side of dying. Just relax and let gravity pull you down. If you had a steady supply of fish though and didn't drink the sea water, you could survive much longer without fresh water because there is water in the meat of the fish. Of course we would just sweat it out because our bodies are like sieves and we really are not built to hold onto water. But if you didn't, if you were built more like a desert mammal, or a cetacean mammal, you might get by without drinking at all.",海洋的哺乳動物如何自身進行水合。,他們有很棒的腎臟。腎臟能夠過濾水以補充身體並去除鹽。人類腎臟並不是太棒了。他們的皮膚確實將水插入了井中。它們具有物理機制，可以在攝入過程中脫鹽。他們在不喝海水的情況下從吃的食物中獲得了相當多的水。他們的腎臟非常有效。可以說，您或我喝了一些海水。我們在普通鹽度下喝12盎司的海水。啊，當您陷入生命筏中時，這很酸，但令人耳目一新。我們的身體像普通一樣吸收水，哇，這是一個好主意！但是我們也吸收了鹽，然後我們必須擺脫鹽。那就是腎臟的工作，但是腎臟沒有傳送帶。沒有腎臟汽車將垃圾產品從腎臟驅動到膀胱。腎臟諷刺的是需要水才能將鹽從體內沖洗出來。問題在於，他們需要的水量超過了您從12盎司海水中獲得的水量。因此，您會暫時刷新，但是您遭受了淨流失，這被您的血液，器官，肌肉和組織所吸收。好的，所以你渴了，所以你喝更多，同樣的事情發生了，現在你的舌頭開始變黑了，你開始搖晃和嘔吐，失去更多的寶貴水，現在你正處於垂死的下坡一面。放鬆一下，讓重力拉下來。如果您的魚類穩定供應，並且沒有喝海水，那麼您可以在沒有淡水的情況下生存更長的時間，因為魚的肉中有水。當然，我們只是出汗，因為我們的身體就像篩子一樣，我們真的不是為了抓住水而建造的。但是，如果您不這樣做，如果您的建造更像是沙漠哺乳動物或鯨類哺乳動物，那麼您可能根本不喝酒。
"""PTSD is a cultural product"" what does that mean?","If I understand this correctly, what its saying is that PTSD only exists as a recognised disorder because of the ability we have to study it. It never used to be recognised. In wars, for example, people would get it and be labelled as cowards, because it wasn't understood what the sufferers were going through. I think its similar to our modern day view of depression. Maybe back in the day, depressed people were seen as someone who just needs to harden up, a bit of a downer all the time. Now, though, we realise its a proper disorder that the patient can't control, as opposed to a voluntary sadness. In the same way, now that we have studying PTSD and its effects, we can recognise it as a disorder, not just someone being anxious and touchy and aggressive.",“ PTSD是一種文化產品”這是什麼意思？,如果我正確理解這一點，那麼它的說法是PTSD僅作為一種公認的疾病而存在，因為我們必須研究它。它從未被認可。例如，在戰爭中，人們會得到它並將其標記為co夫，因為它不了解患者正在經歷什麼。我認為它類似於我們現代的抑鬱症觀點。也許回到過去，沮喪的人被視為只需要加強的人，一直有點沮喪。但是，現在，我們意識到它是一種適當的疾病，患者無法控制，而不是自願的悲傷。同樣，既然我們已經研究了PTSD及其影響，我們就可以將其視為一種疾病，而不僅僅是一個焦慮，敏感和積極進取的人。
"Why can most things in the body be transplanted, except the eyes?","Whole eyes are really tricky to transplant for a few reasons: 1. The retina dies in only 2-4 hours without a blood supply. The donor and recipient would have to be right by each other. 2. The retina is part of the brain, so if a donor is brain dead, the eye would be dead too. You have to harvest the eye right after the donor's heart stops. 3. You have to connect the optic nerve, which has 1.3 million individual nerves that need to link up. 4. You need to suppress the immune system so it doesn't recognize the new eye as a foreign and attack it. Actually this stuff isn't that far off. Researchers have already transplanted eyes in mice who survived for 200 days. But they aren't sure how much vision those mice had restored. Still, even 30% vision restored gives people independence and is better than complete blindness.Anything in the human body can be transplanted, we just lack the science right now to suppress the immune system from attacking the replacement body part without immune suppressant drug therapy for the rest of your life and hope a common cold does not kill you. Nerve ending reattachment science right now is not exactly precise, and is more like trying to connect Lego pieces together with boxing gloves when it comes to spinal cord injuries. Lastly keeping a brain alive in a jar for a significant amount of time is just too far off from reality at this time, but maybe one day this could happen and the science of human integration of robotics bodies could become a reality. _URL_0_', ""NOT A DOCTOR. But I'm going to say its because they have way too much nerve bandwidth. It'd be like trying to get a new spinal chord.Corneas are on every donation checklist. The rest of the eye is pointless after you remove those.",為什麼除了眼睛以外，體內大多數東西都可以移植？,由於幾個原因，整個眼睛的移植確實很棘手：1。視網膜在僅2-4小時內就死亡，沒有血液供應。捐助者和接收者必須彼此正確。2.視網膜是大腦的一部分，因此，如果供體大腦死亡，眼睛也會死亡。捐贈者的心停止後，您必須立即收穫眼睛。3.您必須連接視神經，該視神經有130萬個單獨的神經需要鏈接。4.您需要抑制免疫系統，以便它不識別出新的眼睛並攻擊它。實際上，這些東西並不遙遠。研究人員已經在倖存了200天的小鼠中移植了眼睛。但是他們不確定這些老鼠恢復了多少願景。儘管如此，即使恢復了30％的視力，也能使人們獨立，而且比完全失明。人體可以移植的任何東西，我們現在缺乏科學來抑制免疫系統，無法攻擊替代身體部位，而無需免疫抑製藥物治療您的餘生，並希望普通的感冒不會殺死您。現在的神經結尾科學現在並不十分精確，更像是試圖將樂高積木與拳擊手套連接起來，涉及脊髓損傷。最後，將大腦活在罐子里長時間的時間與現實相距甚遠，但也許有一天可能會發生，並且人類機器人身體整合的科學可能會成為現實。_url_0_'，“不是醫生。但是我要說的是因為它們的神經帶寬太多。這就像試圖獲得新的脊柱和弦。每個捐贈清單上都在於。刪除這些內容後是毫無意義的。
"Weird vibrating eye ""trick""","it's called nystagmus. It can appear as a problem for some people, in which it is uncontrolled, but some people are able to do it voluntarily. Other than the obvious vision problems for people who have involuntary nystagmus and can't 'switch it off', I'm not aware of it being a cause of any sort of damage.",怪異的振動眼睛的“技巧”,它叫做nystagmus。對於某些人來說，它可能是一個問題，而它是不受控制的，但是有些人可以自願這樣做。除了對具有非自願性眼球震顫並且無法“將其關閉”的人出現明顯的視力問題之外，我不知道這是造成任何損害的原因。
"Why are some words considered more offensive/rude than others, despite meaning a very similar or even the exact same thing? I'm referring to swear words mainly.","Similar question has been asked more than once today. It's weird. All languages have curse or swear words; words used to describe acts, ideas, or concepts that are considered taboo by the culture that uses said language. These can vary widely from culture to culture, of course, but the common taboos in western civilization are sex-related. In English, at least, the idea of ""poor"" or ""bad"" language also comes in part from how the language as we know it today developed during the middle ages. In the simplest terms, the common people spoke a different dialect than the Norman French nobility, and the so-called ""vulgar"" vernacular was seen as dirty, impure, and distasteful to the prim and proper Norman overlords.",為什麼有些單詞被認為是比其他單詞更令人反感/粗魯，儘管這意味著非常相似甚至是完全相同的事情？我主要指的是發誓單詞。,今天已經不止一次問了類似的問題。有點奇怪。所有語言都有詛咒或發誓的話；用於描述使用該語言的文化被認為是禁忌的行為，思想或概念的單詞。當然，這些因素可能因文化而異，但西方文明中的常見禁忌與性別有關。至少在英語中，“貧窮”或“不良”語言的想法也部分來自我們今天在中世紀發展的語言。用最簡單的話來說，普通百姓說的方言與諾曼法國貴族不同，所謂的“粗俗”白話被認為是對原始和適當的諾曼王位的骯髒，不純潔和令人反感的。
Why are highway and street signs usually white text on green (at least in the US)?,"You're correct that white and black would provide the greatest contrast, but the primary issue isn't contrast. Highway signs are ""retroreflective,"" meaning that at night, when you shine your headlights on them, the light not only illuminates the sign, but the sign also directly reflects a good amount of that light back at you. Black backgrounds would not be efficient retroreflectors , plus they would be difficult to see at night since the sky is black. Green was chosen since the eye is highly sensitive to green, it is clearly visible day and night, and it is a good retroreflector. Green is a common choice in many countries, including Canada, Japan, China, and Australia. Many European countries opt for blue backgrounds with white text or white backgrounds with black text.",為什麼高速公路和街道標誌通常在綠色上（至少在美國）上為白色？,您是正確的，白色和黑色會提供最大的對比度，但主要問題沒有對比。高速公路標誌是“反射性的”，這意味著，當您在晚上將頭燈照亮時，光線不僅會照亮標誌，而且標誌還直接反映了大量的光線。黑色背景不會是有效的逆轉錄器，而且由於天空為黑色，因此很難在晚上看到它們。選擇綠色是因為眼睛對綠色高度敏感，因此白天和黑夜顯然是可見的，這是一個很好的逆流器。綠色是許多國家，包括加拿大，日本，中國和澳大利亞的常見選擇。許多歐洲國家選擇具有白色文字或白色背景的藍色背景。
Why do vehicles that carry a lot of people not require seatbelts?,"I asked a school-bus driver once about this, and he replied that kids would use the seat belts as weapons. I, for one, could definitely see my teenage self smacking my seatmate with a seatbelt.I've heard that buses don't need seat belts because they'd be useless in most cases. Buses are so heavy that unless they hit a concrete wall they're not going to stop suddenly, they'll slow down gradually at least relative to the way your car will stop if it hits a van or a school bus. It makes sense, I've ridden buses many times but never remember being pushed off the front of my seat while braking.",為什麼攜帶很多人不需要安全帶的車輛？,我曾經問過一個校車司機，他回答說，孩子們會用安全帶作為武器。我肯定可以看到我的少年自我用安全帶打我的同伴。我聽說公共汽車不需要安全帶，因為在大多數情況下它們會毫無用處。公共汽車是如此的重，以至於除非他們撞到混凝土牆，否則他們不會突然停止，否則它們至少相對於您的汽車撞上了麵包車或校車的方式逐漸放慢速度。這是有道理的，我騎了很多次，但不記得在製動時被推開。

Only 5 White Rhinos Left (alive) Worldwide--What does that mean for the Eco-System?,"Specifically, little at this time. But it is a reduction in the biodiversity that keeps the environment healthy. Best way to explain it is to simplify things - let's just hope Disney doesn't sue me. Follow the circle of life - the antelope eat the grass, the lions eat the antelope, the dead lions decay and feed the grass. If all of the lions disappear, the antelope will over populate, eat all the grass, and everyone dies. If the grass dies, the antelope die, and the lions starve. If the antelope migrate, the lions starve, and the grass rules everything. As a single entity, the white rhino's disappearance is not going to destroy the ecosystem - they are part of a greater collection of animals that fill their step in the circle. But their biodiversity is gone, meaning if there was an event that would wipe out the other rhinos but wouldn't have effected the white rhino, the ecosystem does not have the white rhino to fall back on anymore.",全球只有5種白色犀牛（活著） - 這對生態系統意味著什麼？,具體來說，目前幾乎沒有。但這是生物多樣性的減少，可以使環境保持健康。解釋它的最佳方法是簡化事情 - 讓我們希望迪斯尼不要起訴我。遵循生命的圈子 - 羚羊吃草，獅子吃羚羊，死獅腐爛並喂草。如果所有獅子都消失了，羚羊會過度填充，吃所有的草，每個人都死了。如果草死了，羚羊死了，獅子餓了。如果羚羊遷移，獅子餓了，草統治著一切。作為一個單一的實體，白犀牛的消失不會破壞生態系統 - 它們是越來越多的動物收集的一部分，這些動物填補了圓圈的一步。但是他們的生物多樣性已經消失了，這意味著如果有一個事件可以消滅其他犀牛，但不會影響白犀牛，那么生態系統就沒有白犀牛了。
Are product restocking fees BS or is there some legitimacy to them?,"How do you define BS? It costs the business money to have employees around to put the item back into inventory, makes their logistics less efficient, etc. The entire area of return policies is a strange one. Businesses are under no obligation to accept returns for any reason. Anything they do is strictly for marketing or customer retention reasons. How much did the restocking fee affect your willingness to do business with them down the road? Did it affect your initial purchase decision?', ""Sometimes yes, sometimes no. So you buy a laptop and decide to return it. Either A) You opened it, they have to return it to the manufacturer to repackage and maybe confirm the warrantee is all kosher. B) You opened it and they don't return it to the manufacturer, in which case they can't sell the open item for as much. C) You return it in its package, but they have no way of knowing if you filled the box with rocks and put new cellophane on it, so they have to open it anyway. So for high ticket items, restocking can fees can be necessary. I can also see scenarios where business that rely on the logistics and inventory could need to make up some cost. Now is the percentage they charge fair? I don't know - but I also don't know of any company whose business model is built around restocking fees, because it really is a pain in the ass.",產品補貨費是BS還是對它們有合法性？,您如何定義BS？讓員工周圍將物品恢復到庫存，使其物流效率降低，等等。回報政策的整個領域都是奇怪的。由於任何原因，企業沒有義務接受回報。他們所做的任何事情都嚴格出於營銷或客戶保留原因。補貨費影響了您願意與他們開展業務的意願？這有時會影響您最初的購買決定嗎？全是猶太潔食。b）您打開了它，他們不會將其退還給製造商，在這種情況下，他們不能以太多的方式出售開放物品。c）您將其返回，但他們無法兌現。知道您是否用岩石裝滿了盒子並在上面放上新的玻璃紙，因此他們無論如何都必須打開。可能需要彌補一定的成本。現在他們收取的百分比是公平的嗎？我不知道 - 但是我也不知道任何公司的商業模式圍繞著補貨費，因為這確實是屁股的痛苦。
"After an earthquake, how do we tell if a building is structurally sound enough to re-enter and use again?","If there's internal damage, there will always be some amount of external damage. The amount of external damage can be very small compared to the internal damage, misleadingly so, but there will always be some. And yeah there are a lot of things you look for. Small cracks are expected in certain materials, and don't necessarily mean its unsafe. Other things are more obvious. If you see piles of debris, a lot of broken windows, huge cracks or the building is actually tilting, its best you stay away. For large buildings, they just don't let anyone go in until professionals can inspect the structure to see if its safe or not. With smaller structures and homes, you can have the people occupying it look for any obvious signs of problems, and make judgement calls until an inspector can get around to it Ultimately, its usually pretty obvious if there are any major structural problems.",地震後，我們如何確定建築物在結構上是否足夠重新進入並再次使用？,如果內部損壞，總會造成一定程度的外部損害。與內部損害相比，外部損壞的量可能很小，但誤導性的損失量可能會很小，但是總會有一些損害。是的，您要尋找很多東西。某些材料的裂縫預期是小裂縫，不一定意味著其不安全。其他事情更為明顯。如果您看到一堆碎屑，窗戶碎片，巨大的裂縫或建築物實際上在傾斜，最好您遠離。對於大型建築物，他們只是不讓任何人進入，直到專業人員可以檢查結構以查看其安全性是否安全。借助較小的結構和房屋，您可以讓佔領它的人尋找任何明顯的問題跡象，並進行判斷，直到檢查員最終可以到達它，如果有任何重大的結構性問題，通常很明顯。
The psychology behind game grinding,"There's two - there's MMO Grinding, and there's classic JRPG Grinding. With MMO Grinding, it's a [Skinner Box]. Push button, receive reward. Early in the game you're rewarded for doing damn near anything. Talk to someone - get a level. Cast a spell, get a level. As you go up in levels, it stretches out more and more, leading you to do the same repetitive tasks for the reward. It's why people do high level dungeons over and over and over again - they're grinding for the ""reward"" of a slightly different colored items with slightly higher numbers on them than the item they already have. With classic JRPG grinding, it's a mechanic to stretch out the gameplay. Selling a game with 20 hours of gameplay when your competitors claim to have 60 is going to get your game ignored. So rather than assume the player will gain two levels traveling to the next area's boss, you tweak it so that you need to add at least ten levels, maybe more. Item prices are much higher as are spell or item prices. This forces the player to fight random encounters for hours on end to gain the experience and money needed to beat the next boss and move on to the rest of the game. The first is . when it's done well, you don't notice it. When it's done poorly, it's all the game is.

How does the ISS maintain it's altitude without crashing into the planet?,"So you know when your throw a ball it follows a curved path down back to the ground? Well the ISS is moving so fast and is so high up that it's curved path equals the curvature of the earth, so it approaches the earth just as fast the earth curves away from it, so the distance between the earth and the station remain, fairly, constant.",國際空間站如何在不撞到地球的情況下保持其高度？,因此，您知道當您扔球時，它會沿著彎曲的路徑向下回到地面嗎？嗯，國際空間站的移動速度如此之快，並且彎曲的路徑很高，以至於地球的彎曲度等於地球的距離，地球彎曲得同樣快，因此地球與站點之間的距離保持不變，， 持續的。
Why do I have to pee when I'm nervous?,"You may have heard of the 'fight or flight response.' When you are stressed your body releases hormones to help your body deal with the situation - the best known one is adrenaline. This hormone tells your body to do a whole bunch of things, and urinate is among them. It is suggested that this might be to lighten your body to make it easier for you to run.",為什麼當我緊張時必須撒尿？,您可能聽說過“戰鬥或飛行反應”。當您受到壓力時，您的身體會釋放激素，以幫助您的身體應對這種情況 - 最著名的是腎上腺素。這種激素告訴您的身體做很多事情，其中包括小便。建議這可能是減輕您的身體，以使您更容易跑步。
What is stopping us from just replacing our natural adult teeth with synthetic ones?,"Mostly Price. Where I live it costs around £1000-£1500 for 1 dental implantWe can and occasionally do, but why surgically rip out your teeth and implant fake ones when the originals do a fine job on their own? You still have to clean and maintain the fakes, bacteria will try to colonize them both.I think you're underestimating the awesomeness of bone teeth.",是什麼阻止我們僅用合成牙齒代替天然的成年牙齒？,主要是價格。我住在那裡的地方，1牙植物植入植物的費用約為1000英鎊至1500英鎊，偶爾可以做，但是為什麼當原件自己做得很好時，為什麼要手術撕下牙齒並植入假的牙齒呢？您仍然必須清潔和維護假貨，細菌會試圖將它們殖民在兩者中。我認為您低估了骨頭牙齒的驚人性。
"Since whales are mammals, and need water to live like we do, how do they get it if they live in salt water, which is bad to drink?","They get it from the food that they eat. Whales, and dolphins, can't starve to death, they die of dehydration first. They do get a little bit from sea water but their kidneys can't remove much salt so if they accidentally drink too much sea water when they eat that could kill them.",由於鯨魚是哺乳動物，需要像我們一樣的水來生存，因此如果他們住在鹽水中，它們如何飲用？,他們從吃的食物中得到它。鯨魚和海豚不能餓死，他們首先死於脫水。他們的確會從海水中得到一點，但是他們的腎臟不能去除太多鹽，因此，如果他們在吃東西時不小心喝了太多的海水，可能會殺死它們。
"How exactly a silent approval of criminal acts by law enforcement authorities goes through in modern, western countries?","You've kind of hit the nail on the head. It tends to vary from place to place, but I think a lot of law enforcement organisations don't see a great deal of point going after small-time drug dealers. As you say, there's always going to be demand for drugs and if any police do turn up it's pretty easy just to disappear. In Japan, 'grey area' industries like prostitution and drug dealing are technically illegal, but run by the Yakuza, who's existence is tolerated by the state. They don't want to make that stuff legal, but it's going to happen, so better that it happens in the open.You illustrated the answer with your words "" peacefully, almost kindly ask you if you are interested in drugs"". Why should the police make a fuss over people doing anything peacefully and kindly? The police in many civilized countries would rather spend their time dealing with people who are being unpeaceful and unkind.",在現代，西方國家，執法當局對犯罪行為的無聲認可如何？,您已經擊中了指甲。它往往會因地點而異，但我認為許多執法組織並沒有看到小小的毒品交易商的重點。正如您所說，總是有對毒品的需求，如果有任何警察出現，就很容易消失。在日本，諸如賣淫和毒品交易之類的“灰色地區”行業在技術上是非法的，但由Yakuza經營，Yakuza的存在是由國家容忍的。他們不想使這些事情合法，但它會發生，更好地發生在公開賽中。警察為什麼要大驚小怪地和平，友善地做任何事情？許多文明國家的警察寧願花時間與那些不安心和不友善的人打交道。
Why do we move our body (by either dancing or simply bouncing our head) to music? What exactly in our body is causing this?,"Actions speak louder than words. Movement can encode aggression or play or healing or prayer or mating or celebration or grief. Movement attracts attention because people need to know how to interpret your intentions. Someone dancing through the front door of a bank will draw a different attention than someone dancing the same way through the door of a club, so context is also in play. Any gesture or movement, done in unison by a group, becomes a rhythmic dance that encodes some agreed on meaning; waving baseball caps up and down in the dugout helps the batter get a hit, or at least feel the support of his teammates. Now for the music side of your question. Music induces emotions in the audience. Good musical technique has been defined as the audience experiencing the emotions that the musician has prepared for them. The derivation of the word \'emotion\' contains this: from Latin emovere ""move out, remove, agitate,"". This are all actions. So the simple answer is that music can make a group of people feel emotional, and if the emotions are strong enough, the group will move their bodies . Getting our emotions outside of ourselves lets us celebrate and control ourselves. Here's where the confusion comes in: Calm. This could be indifference to the music. This could be unfamiliarity with a specific kind of music. This could also be the intent of the music; creating a calm state of mind. Calm is not an emotion in the classical sense; it is stillness embodied and lacks agitation. However, in the modern sense of states of mind, calm is just another energy level that we can measure and it happens to be associated with stillness rather than actions. The function that ties all this together is a shared experience. The musician creates it and the audience participates in it. And that, IMHO, is why we dance.",為什麼我們要（通過跳舞或簡單地彈跳我們的頭部）將身體移動到音樂上？我們體內到底是什麼造成了？,行動勝於雄辯。運動可以編碼侵略性，玩耍，治愈，祈禱，交配或慶祝或悲傷。運動引起人們的注意，因為人們需要知道如何解釋您的意圖。有人在銀行的前門跳舞將引起與通過俱樂部門跳舞的人不同的關注，因此上下文也在發揮作用。任何一個由小組一致完成的手勢或動作都將成為一種有節奏的舞蹈，該舞蹈編碼一些同意的意義。在獨木舟中上下揮舞棒球有助於擊球手擊中，或者至少感受到了隊友的支持。現在是您問題的音樂方面。音樂引起觀眾的情感。良好的音樂技術被定義為觀眾經歷了音樂家為他們準備的情感。單詞\'情感\'的派生包含以下內容：摘自拉丁語Emovere“移出，刪除，攪動”。這都是行動。因此，簡單的答案是，音樂可以使一群人感到情緒化，如果情緒足夠強烈，小組將移動他們的身體。讓我們的情緒在自己之外，讓我們慶祝和控制自己。這是混亂的來源：冷靜。這可能對音樂無動於衷。這可能是一種特定的音樂不熟悉的。這也可能是音樂的意圖。創造一個平靜的心態。在經典意義上，鎮定不是一種情感。它體現了靜止，缺乏攪動。但是，從現代的心態意義上講，平靜只是我們可以衡量的另一個能量水平，它恰好與靜止不動而不是行動有關。將所有這些聯繫在一起的功能是共同的經驗。音樂家創造了它，觀眾參與其中。恕我直言，這就是我們跳舞的原因。
How are outside noises able to be incorporated into your dream?,"Brains are complex things. While dreaming you are thought to be basically consolidating the memories you want to keep and not keep, and you create scenes in your mind involving things that were important to you recently . So while your brain is doing all of that, your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth are still wired in. Incoming stimuli from any one of those sensory organs can be implemented into the seemingly chaotic mess of neural activity that we call dreaming.",外部噪音如何能夠納入您的夢想中？,大腦是複雜的事情。在做夢的同時，人們認為您基本上要整合要保留和不保留的記憶，並且在腦海中創建了涉及最近對您重要的事物的場景。因此，儘管您的大腦正在做所有這些，但您的耳朵，眼睛，鼻子和嘴仍然被連接起來。從任何一個感官器官中的任何一個傳入的刺激都可以實現為我們稱為夢想的看似混亂的神經活動。
How does restarting something (i.e. a computer or a PlayStation or such) work?,"PC hardware comes typically with only a single program baked in, called the ""bootloader"". This program is designed to boot up whatever Operating System, or OS, has been installed on it. When you turn on the PC or PS4, it starts the bootloader, which is a relatively small program that simply loads the PS4 OS or Windows or MacOS or Android, etc. When you restart the PC or PS4 , the OS program exits with an additional instruction to the bootloader program to reload the OS. And that's exactly what the bootloader does: it resets the starting environment and loads the OS, as though it had been turned on for the first time. *edit, phrasing*",重新啟動某些內容（即計算機或PlayStation之類的）如何工作？,PC硬件通常僅帶有一個烤製的單個程序，稱為“引導加載程序”。該程序旨在啟動已安裝的任何操作系統或操作系統。當您打開PC或PS4時，它將啟動Bootloader，這是一個相對較小的程序，只需加載PS4 OS，Windows或MacOS或Android等。重新啟動PC或PS4時，OS程序將帶有附加指令啟動加載程序程序重新加載操作系統。這正是引導加載程序所做的：它重置啟動環境並加載OS，就好像它是第一次打開的一樣。*編輯，措辭**
"Why are we so reluctant to kill animals nowadays when, in the past, our society used hunt all the time and feel no remorse?","People live sheltered lives, some going through all of it without killing any animals or getting into a fight. There's also social conditioning, people being told since they're toddlers that it's a heinous act to hurt people and animals. People like to elevate themselves to a moral highground by bashing the 'barbaric' practices of their ancestors, something they can afford to do because they've never experienced starvation. Killing animals is necessary to our survival, the only difference is that nowadays the majority of people don't have to get their hands dirty to enjoy the meat and hides.",為什麼在過去，我們的社會一直在使用狩獵而不感到re悔時，為什麼我們如此不願殺死動物？,人們過著庇護的生活，有些人不殺死任何動物或打架。還有社會條件，人們被告知，因為他們是幼兒，這是傷害人和動物的令人髮指的行為。人們喜歡通過抨擊祖先的“野蠻”習俗來提升自己的道德高地，因為他們從未經歷過飢餓，因此可以負擔得起的事情。殺人對我們的生存是必要的，唯一的區別是，如今，大多數人不必弄髒手來享受肉類和皮。
how does depression change the way you think?,"So I'm not quite sure why you have this labeled as chemistry, so I'm going to do my best to mention chemistry, but this is more of a biology question. You have these things called **neurotransmitters**. Some of them dictate how you feel. Serotonin is a mood stabilizer, it's very important in making sure you can have ""normal"" emotions. Some people have problems with their serotonin levels, take me. I make maybe half or less of the normal serotonin that a healthy person does. This leads to difficulty controlling my emotions, especially those of anger and depression. Depression has many forms besides the one above, but in most cases it can become very difficult to think happy thoughts. You may have self deprecating thoughts or focus solely on the negatives. Final point: depression is different for everyone, and this answer is influenced by **my** experience. Hope this answered your question.",抑鬱症如何改變您的想法？,因此，我不太確定您為什麼將其標記為化學反應，所以我將盡力提及化學反應，但這更多是一個生物學問題。您有這些稱為**神經遞質**的東西。他們中的一些人決定了您的感受。5-羥色胺是一種情緒穩定劑，這對於確保您可以具有“正常”情緒非常重要。有些人的5-羥色胺水平有問題，請帶我。我可能是健康人所做的正常5-羥色胺的一半或更少。這導致難以控制我的情緒，尤其是憤怒和沮喪的情緒。抑鬱症除了上面的一種形式，但在大多數情況下，人們可能很難思考快樂的想法。您可能有自我貶低的思想或僅關注負面因素。最後一點：每個人的抑鬱症都不同，這個答案受**我的**經驗的影響。希望這能回答您的問題。

And what they used to call ""political economics"" is now just ""economics"". ""Moral economics"" is just some self-righteous people trying to tell everyone else what to do. It is not particularly comparable to economics as a whole, any more than ""I like blue and so should you"" is comparable to ""color exists and is a property of light as perceived by the brain through the eyes"".

What is being 'calculated' by supercomputers?,"I work at a research university, and system administration of our supercomputers falls under my team's responsibilities. What ours supercomputer do is simulation. They simulate things like chemicals interactions, nuclear reactions, electronic systems, and many other things. In many areas of research, it is a lot cheaper to develop models that can be simulated in supercomputers to test ideas, instead of experimenting with real world systems. Our research groups use their models on our supercomputers to research solar energy, advanced films, water treatment, artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and a lot more. All of this requires a lot of processing power because 1, these are complex models involving the interactions between multiple dimensions of variables; 2, because being able to perform calculations faster means either getting results sooner, or being able to simulate systems in more detail, with better results.",超級計算機正在“計算”什麼？,我在一所研究大學工作，超級計算機的系統管理屬於我團隊的職責。我們的超級計算機的作用是仿真。他們模擬了化學相互作用，核反應，電子系統和許多其他事物之類的東西。在許多研究領域，開發可以在超級計算機中模擬的模型來測試想法而不是嘗試現實世界系統的模型要便宜得多。我們的研究小組使用他們的模型在我們的超級計算機上研究太陽能，高級電影，水處理，人工智能，醫學成像等等。所有這些都需要大量的處理能力，因為1，這些是涉及變量多個維度之間相互作用的複雜模型；2，因為能夠更快地執行計算意味著要么更快地獲得結果，要么能夠更詳細地模擬系統，並獲得更好的結果。
"How does Italy regard it's history in terms of their involvement in WW2 different from their ""ally"" Germany?","Because at one point during the war the Italian King had Mussolini arrested and at this point Italy was not part of the Axis anymore. Germany, from an ally became an invading force of Italy. Also, the anti-Jewish laws were repealed by the new Badoglio government while the war was still going on. Basically, by the end of the war, Italy was not viewed as one of the 'bad guys' anymore. So while for Germany there were the [Nuremberg trials], where all the atrocities committed by Germany came into surface, no such trial took place against Italy. So it's a combination of two things: a. Italy probably didn't commit atrocities comparable to Germany; b. any war crimes Italy did commit did not undergo the same level of inquiry of those commited by Germany.My Great Grandfather took part of invading Sicily, and he described it as almost a liberation. The Italians cheered the allied forces and he became friends with many, even a ""POW"". From what i understood from him, he was very well liked, his troop would share their candy rations with the kids, and he got blessed by Pope Pius XII. I feel the Italians were not as caught up in the ""Nazi Craze"" as the Germans were.Italy gave hitler the framework for the nazis, tried to act hard, even gassed Ethiopians Things got hard and they tucked up their penises and ran, crap enemies, crap allies, crap from top to bottom. Italy is shaped like a boot because that much shit won't fit into a running shoe.",意大利如何將其參與WW2的歷史與“盟友”德國不同？,因為在戰爭期間的某一時刻，意大利國王逮捕了墨索里尼，而在這一點上，意大利不再是軸心的一部分。來自盟友的德國成為意大利的入侵力量。此外，在戰爭仍在進行時，新的Badoglio政府廢除了反猶太法律。基本上，到戰爭結束時，意大利不再被視為“壞人”之一。因此，在德國有[紐倫堡審判]的情況下，德國犯下的所有暴行都浮出水面，但沒有對意大利進行這種審判。因此，這是兩件事的組合：意大利可能沒有犯與德國相當的暴行。b。意大利犯罪的任何戰爭罪行都沒有經過對德國造成的人的詢問。意大利人歡呼盟軍，他與許多人，甚至是“戰俘”成為朋友。從我對他的了解，他非常喜歡他，他的部隊會與孩子們分享他們的糖果口糧，他得到了教皇庇護十二世的祝福。我覺得意大利人並沒有像德國人那樣陷入“納粹熱潮”中。TISTITAL給希特勒一個納粹的框架，試圖努力行動，甚至是埃塞俄比亞人的事情都艱難了敵人，廢話盟友，從上到下的廢話。意大利的形狀像靴子一樣，因為這麼多的狗屎不適合跑步鞋。

How can they clone living animals?,"Well, most people use the word ""clone"" to mean something other than it actually is. I blame the popular sci-fi use of cloning to refer to creating an exact duplicate of a person, along with their memories and personality and such. In real life, cloning means to take the DNA of an animal, and create a new baby animal with the same DNA. So it's more like creating a new identical twin baby of the original creature, and not at all like creating an exact copy of that creatureThe how part is that you take the DNA from the living animal, grab an egg cell from the same species and replace the DNA in the egg with the DNA from the live animal. Then you transfer the now fertilized egg into the womb of a surrogate mother. After gestation, you have a genetic duplicate of the original.",他們如何克隆活著的動物？,好吧，大多數人使用“克隆”一詞來表示實際上的意思。我歸咎於克隆流行的科幻用法是指創建一個人的確切重複，以及他們的記憶和個性等。在現實生活中，克隆意味著拿動物的DNA，並用相同的DNA創建新的嬰兒動物。因此，這更像是創建原始生物的一個新的相同的雙胞胎嬰兒，而不像創建該創造物的精確副本雞蛋中的DNA與活動物的DNA。然後，您將現在受精卵的雞蛋轉移到替代母親的子宮中。妊娠後，您將獲得原始的遺傳重複。
"the difference between shampoo, conditioner, body soap, 2-in-1 and 3-in-1.","Shampoo is a type of soap designed for your hair. It gets grease out of your hair. You should only shampoo your head.

Body soap is a soap designed for your skin. It gets dirt off your skin. You can't just wash dirt and grease off with water because water and oil don't mix. Soap is an ""emulsifier"" it means that it makes it so water can wash away oil. 2-in-1 is conditioner and shampoo mixed together. So you only have to use one product to wash your hair. There's a lot of rumors that it's bad for your hair. From what I 've learned, if you have very fine hair then it's better to not use a 2 in 1.

When you break an asteroid into two pieces, the energy of the original asteroid just gets split between the two, so all of that energy is still headed towards Earth. This is equally true of breaking it into 2 pieces and breaking it into a million pieces. You're not going to reduce an asteroid to sand-sized pieces, but even if you did all of that sand is going to hit the Earth. This could be bad in and of itself as all of that energy gets transferred to the atmosphere in the form of heat, although that is probably not an apocalyptic event in and of itself. However, the bit thing to realize is that the asteroid isn't going to be split into a billion pieces the size of pebbles/sand. There are going to be *lots* of pieces that are still large enough to make it to the ground. By breaking the asteroid up you are just spreading the destruction over a wider area of the planet's surface. This would be like replacing a cannon ball with grapeshot--it's still highly destructive. Ultimately nuking an asteroid would probably have *some* positive effect, but if all of the pieces are still hitting the Earth then it's not really worth it. By contrast, if we find an apocalyptic asteroid with the Earth in its sites we can send a sapcecraft to it to alter its orbit ever so slightly so that it doesn't actually hit the Earth. If we detect the object early enough then the change to its orbit would not have to be that much.",為什麼要努力邁向地球的小行星不是一個好策略。,首先，讓我們假設我們有核切碎小行星的核武器。這可能是一個漫長的鏡頭，但是核武器釋放了一個 *很多 *的能量和小行星，不一定像地球上典型的岩石那樣堅固。最大的事情是地球仍在擊中。當您將小行星分成兩塊時，原始小行星的能量只是在兩者之間分開，因此所有能量仍然朝向地球。將其分成2件並將其分成一百萬件同樣如此。您不會將小行星減少到沙子尺寸的碎片，但是即使您做了所有的沙子，也將擊中地球。這本身可能是不好的，因為所有這些能量都以熱的形式轉移到大氣中，儘管這本身可能不是世界末日的事件。但是，要意識到的一點是，小行星不會像鵝卵石/沙子大小分為十億塊。仍然有很多仍然足夠大的碎片將其落在地面上。通過打破小行星，您只是將破壞散佈在地球表面的更廣闊區域上。這就像用grapeshot代替大砲球一樣 - 它仍然具有很高的破壞性。最終，對小行星進行核能可能會產生 *一些積極的效果，但是如果所有的碎片仍在擊中地球，那就不值得。相比之下，如果我們在其地點發現了一個世界末日的小行星，我們可以將Sapcecraft發送到其略微改變其軌道，以使其實際上不會擊中地球。如果我們足夠早點檢測到對象，那麼對軌道的變化就不必那麼多了。
Why are Canada Geese called such instead of Canadian Geese?,"Because it's their name, not their nationality. If I live in New York, and my name is Bob France, you wouldn't call me French.",為什麼加拿大的鵝被稱為這樣的而不是加拿大鵝？,因為這是他們的名字，而不是他們的國籍。如果我住在紐約，我叫鮑勃·法國，你不會叫我法國人。
Did Rob Ford actually help the city of Toronto?,"[Here's a good article that goes over the positive outcome for Toronto] tl;dr: While Ford's campaign was based on ""stopping the gravy train"", he never found one. Gravy leaked out of small cracks in municipal government. Ford saved $100,000 here and there by combining depts, etc. Didn't see it mentioned in the article, but ~$12mil saved by privatizing garbage collection. Started MUCH needed repairs on the elevated Gardiner Expressway . Nothing came out of it thanks to council and provincial government, but Ford was adamant about adding and expanding subway lines.",羅布·福特（Rob Ford）真的幫助多倫多市嗎？,"[這是一篇很好的文章，涵蓋了多倫多的積極結果] TL; DR：福特的競選活動是基於“停止肉汁火車”的，但他從未找到。肉汁從市政府的小裂縫中洩漏出來。福特通過組合部門等在此處和那裡節省了100,000美元。在高架加德納高速公路上開始了急需的維修。借助理事會和省政府，這一切都沒有提出，但是福特堅決要增加和擴大地鐵線路。"
Why do basements/cellars tend to attract mold and mildew so much?,"A cellar is usually colder then the outside as it is kept dark and surrounded by cold dirt. Humidity is based on not only the amount of water in the air but also the temperature of the air. So when air gets down into the basement and gets cooled down its humidity increases. All life needs water to thrive. Basements with a lot of humidity will have a lot more humidity so it is easier for mold to get the water it needs.Mold and mildew thrive in locations which are dark, moist, and cool. Basements are often a perfect environment for mold and mildew because they don't see a ton of sunlight, are usually cooler than other parts of the house, and are usually moist environments especially when they are unfinished.The best habitats for mold and mildew are cold, dark, and humid. In a basement, away from the light of the sun, it is all three . That makes basements a good place for them to grow.",為什麼地下室/地窖傾向於吸引黴菌和黴菌？,地窖通常比外面更冷，因為它保持黑暗並被寒冷的污垢包圍。濕度不僅基於空氣中的水量，而且基於空氣溫度。因此，當空氣進入地下室並冷卻其濕度時。所有生命都需要水才能繁衍生息。濕度很多的地下室將具有更大的濕度，因此黴菌更容易獲得所需的水。在黑暗，濕潤和涼爽的位置，黴菌和黴菌蓬勃發展。地下室通常是黴菌和黴菌的理想環境寒冷，黑暗和潮濕。在地下室，遠離太陽的光，這是三個。這使地下室成為他們成長的好地方。
Is it possible to have more than one type of flu (bacterial or viral) running in your body at the same time?,"Just to clarify a little more ""Flu"" does not just mean illness. It is specifically illness caused by *Influenza* viruses. In fact \'flu\' is short for \'influenza\'. The term ""bacterial flu"" is misleading because it means a bacterial infection occurring because your immune system has been weakened by the flu virus. So you can't have bacterial flu without having ""actual"" influenza caused by the influenza virus. So your answer is in your question. You can only have what is confusingly described as ""bacterial flu"" if you have viral flu. If you're using the word ""flu"" to describe any illness with similar symptoms then yes, you can definitely have as many infections as you would care to pick up. It will eventually kill you. Immune disorders are such a problem because you end up with every disease and infection out there and it becomes impossible to stop the sufferer getting sick and dying from any and all kinds of infections.",是否可以同時在體內運行多種流感（細菌或病毒）？,只是為了澄清更多的“流感”，不僅意味著疾病。它是由 *流感 *病毒引起的。實際上，\'flu \'是\'流感\'的簡短。“細菌流感”一詞具有誤導性，因為它意味著您的免疫系統已被流感病毒削弱，因此發生了細菌感染。因此，如果沒有流感病毒引起的“實際”流感，就無法患有細菌流感。因此，您的答案在於您的問題。如果您患有病毒流感，您只能具有令人困惑的“細菌流感”。如果您使用“流感”一詞來描述任何具有類似症狀的疾病，那麼是的，您絕對可以隨心所欲地感染。它最終會殺死你。免疫疾病是一個問題，因為您最終會出現每種疾病和感染，而不可能阻止患者生病並死於任何種種感染。

Partly Sunny:Between 3/8 and 5/8 of the sky is covered by clouds. The term ""Partly Sunny"" is used only during daylight hours.",“部分多雲”和“部分陽光”的預測有什麼區別？,部分多雲意味著有些雲的藍天部分陽光明媚，這意味著偶爾的陽光實際上找到了多雲的天空，實際上是由於NOAA找到了答案，這裡是：部分多雲：在天空的3/8至5/8之間，覆蓋著雲。部分晴天：天空的3/8至5/8之間被雲覆蓋。“部分陽光”一詞僅在白天使用。
Why do humans express ourselves creatively?,"**TL;DR**: *We have intelligence and spare time and a desire to accomplish something and to leave something behind or give something to other people. Being creative uses the first to fill the second and fulfill those desires.* In terms of flair, this isn't so much about culture as it is biology. The first reason is that we're a thinking animal that isn't driven solely by instinct. We have thought processes that very very routinely move us out of the realms of ""automatically do X when the environment is like Y"", which cause a caterpillar to munch when placed on a leaf or a deer to run when it hears a loud noise. Then there's our lifespan and living standards. We do not sleep or have to search for food and shelter and comfort and mating every single second of every single day. We have ""down time"" and the intelligence to both use that ""down time"", and want to use that ""down time"" somehow or we'll get bored. Finally that intelligence causes many of us to seek creative satisfaction, and to serve some purpose. We want something called \'fulfillment\' out of life. It can be a public form of fulfillment for some where they're recognized by others for what they do, a feeling of pride for having helped others feel better by doing an excellent stand-up comedy or rap song or dance routine that spreads joy, or an entirely internal drive which causes someone to feel very satisfied when they have accomplished something creative like completing a work of sculpture. All three things - time, ability enabled by intelligence, and the need for some form of personal fulfillment, lead to creative expression. And the level varies greatly from person to person, dictating how central that need is to the way they live their life.",人類為什麼創造性地表達自己？,** tl; dr **：*我們有智慧和業餘時間，並渴望完成某件事並拋棄某些東西或給其他人。創造性利用第一個來填補第二個慾望。第一個原因是，我們是一種思維動物，不僅是由本能驅動的。我們的思考過程非常常規地將我們從“當環境一樣自動進行X”的領域中移出，當將毛毛蟲放在葉子或鹿上時，當它聽到大聲的噪音時，會導致毛毛蟲會咀嚼。然後是我們的壽命和生活水平。我們不睡覺或不得不尋找食物和庇護所和舒適感，並每天每一天交配。我們有“停機時間”和智能都使用“停機時間”，並希望以某種方式使用“停機時間”，否則我們會感到無聊。最後，情報使我們許多人尋求創造性的滿足感，並達到一些目的。我們想要一生中所謂的“履行”。對於某些人來說，這可能是一種公開形式的實現形式，因為他們所做的事情被別人認可，這是通過製作出色的站立喜劇，說唱歌曲或舞蹈散佈喜悅的感覺而感到自豪的感覺，或者是一個完全內部的驅動器，這會使某人完成創造力（例如完成雕塑作品）時感到非常滿意。這三件事 - 時間，通過智力來實現的能力以及對某種形式的個人成就的需求，會導致創造性的表達。人與人之間的水平差異很大，決定了他們生活的生活方式的中心程度。
"When people go outside to take a breath of fresh air, why does that help calm them down?","Going outside firstly removes the trigger and stimulus that's causing the stress - and so they can get out of an emotionally charged situation. Fresh air may also be a change in temperature, so they have a different physical response too, and that may help them breathe deeper, giving the stress hormones a chance to disperse",當人們出去呼吸新鮮空氣時，為什麼這有助於使他們平靜下來？,首先出門去消除引起壓力的觸發因素和刺激 - 因此他們可以擺脫充滿情感的情況。新鮮空氣也可能是溫度的變化，因此它們也有不同的身體反應，這可能有助於他們更深地呼吸，使壓力荷爾蒙有機會分散
I just read the Brian Banks story; Why are women who falsley accuse men of rape hardly ever if at all sent to prison?,"If they were proved, in a court of law, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have knowingly and falsely accused someone, they do get sent to prison.There is a difference between a false accusation, an accused raper being found not-guilty, and being criminally liable. It is possible that someone gave false witness that they reasonably thought was true. Alternatively, there may have simply not been enough evidence to prove it was rape, but it also does not mean the person was lying . Finally there is the case where one party intentionally lies to try and get the other in trouble . In this case it would be criminal liable and the accuser could get criminally prosecuted.",我剛剛讀了布萊恩·班克斯的故事。為什麼如果完全被送入監獄，為什麼錯誤地指責男人犯有強姦罪？,如果在法庭上證明了他們有意地和錯誤地指責某人，他們確實被送進了監獄。對犯罪負責。有人合理地認為是真實的，有可能有人給出了虛假的見證。另外，可能根本沒有足夠的證據證明這是強姦，但這也不意味著這個人在撒謊。最後，有一個政黨故意撒謊，試圖讓另一方陷入困境。在這種情況下，這將是刑事責任的，而原告可能會受到刑事起訴。
How is Yahoo still a top 5 most visited website?,"A tremendous number of browsers came with it auto-homepaged in the earlier days of the internet. It was the preferred way of accessing search functionality when the web really started taking off, and it had excellent branding. And that stuck, and stuck hard. A whole lot of older users have it as their home page, so every time they browse the web they start there because that's what they did ten or fifteen years ago.",Yahoo如何仍然是訪問量最高的前5名網站？,在互聯網的早期，隨附了大量瀏覽器。當網絡真正開始起飛時，這是訪問搜索功能的首選方法，並且具有出色的品牌。那卡住了，堅硬。許多較老的用戶都將其作為主頁，因此每次瀏覽網絡時，他們都會從那裡開始，因為那是十五年前他們所做的。

"What does the term ""too big to fail"" mean?","It's a commonly used phrase to mean ""this company is so big and does so much business that if it were to fail and go under, it would have massive negative effects on the economy as a whole."" For example: We have a lot of banks in the US, but we have some *really really big* ones, too. When those banks started to fail, they were big enough that they caused massive, very bad effects to the economy of the *entire country* and frankly even extending out to foreign countries as well. Since those companies are *too big to fail,* the government needed to step in and help them to not fail in order to prevent another Great Depression.",“太大而失敗”一詞是什麼意思？,這是一個常用的短語，意味著“這家公司是如此之大，並且做得如此之多，以至於如果要失敗並陷入困境，它將對整個經濟產生巨大的負面影響。”例如：我們在美國有很多銀行，但是我們也有一些 *真的很大 *。當這些銀行開始失敗時，它們足夠大，以至於對整個國家的經濟造成了巨大的，非常不利的影響 *，甚至坦率地說，甚至延伸到了國外。由於這些公司 *太大而無法失敗， *政府需要介入，並幫助他們不要失敗，以防止另一個大蕭條。

Please ELI5 the concept of IPOs and what are the effects of this IPO to companies that did not previously have this.,"IPO = Initial Public Offering Could also be called ""Taking a company public"" ELI5 version - You own a company. It is not small, but not as large as you want it to be. You could borrow money from a bank in order to grow your business, but for a bunch of reasons banks are not always willing or able to loan you large sums of money. Instead, you offer to sell ownership of your company to the general public - in the form of shares - in exchange for their money. In effect, your company is now partially owned by private individuals and investors, and you have more money to invest in further business development. There are huge legal implications of this. Every country has security laws which must be followed when you take a company public. This is mostly to prevent abuse of the public through various scams and insider trading.",請eli5 IPO的概念以及該IPO對以前沒有此的公司有什麼影響。,IPO =首次公開募股也可以稱為“公開公司” ELI5版本 - 您擁有一家公司。它並不小，但不如您想要的那麼大。您可以從銀行借錢以發展您的業務，但是出於許多原因，銀行並非總是願意或能夠向您借出大筆款項。相反，您提出將公司的所有權以股票形式出售給公眾，以換取他們的錢。實際上，您的公司現在由私人和投資者部分擁有，您有更多的錢來投資進一步的業務發展。這有很大的法律意義。每個國家都有安全法，當您將公司公開時必須遵循。這主要是為了防止通過各種騙局和內幕交易濫用公眾。
Why is tinfoil (aluminum foil) so heat resistant?,"Heat resistent in what way? If you refer to ""Why doesn't it melt"", simply because it's melting point is incredibly high, much higher than your grill can produce . If you are instead refering to ""Why doesn't it get super hot to the touch"" then you're building on a wrong premise: it isn't heat resistant at all and does get hot. It gets just as hot as the food underneath it. However tinfoil is so thin and so large that any heat that it does have dissapitates into the surrounding air almost instantly. Things that have little mass cannot hold as well to their energy as more massive things, and things with large surface area cool down faster than things that have lower area.",為什麼錫箔（鋁箔）如此耐熱？,耐熱方式是什麼？如果您指的是“為什麼不融化”，僅僅是因為它的熔點非常高，比您的燒烤架產生的要高得多。如果您是指“為什麼不超級觸摸”，那麼您就以錯誤的前提進行構建：它根本不是耐熱性，而且確實變得很熱。它變得和下面的食物一樣熱。但是，錫箔是如此薄且如此大，以至於幾乎立即散發到周圍空氣中的任何熱量。幾乎沒有質量的事物不能像更大的東西一樣持有其能量，而且表面積較大的東西比面積較低的事物更快。
Why do french fries taste good while they're hot and nasty cold?,"Your tongue can detect basic flavours only: sweetness, saltiness, sourness, etc. Most of what we call the sense of taste is actually sense of smell. The smell of food while eating comes from molecules being carried from the food into your nose via the back of your mouth. Food that is hot gives off loads of these molecules, but food that is cold gives off hardly any. Hence a large part of the flavour of food is lost when it is cold, so your fries no longer taste as good.",為什麼炸薯條在炎熱和令人討厭的寒冷時味道很好？,您的舌頭只能檢測到基本口味：甜度，咸，酸味等。我們所說的大多數口味感實際上都是嗅覺。進食時食物的氣味來自通過口腔從食物從食物中傳遞到鼻子的分子。熱的食物散發出這些分子的負載，但是冷食物幾乎沒有散發出來。因此，當寒冷時，食物的大部分味道都會消失，因此您的薯條不再那麼好。
How are we able to measure space?,"There are several methods to calculate the distance of a celestial body. Which one is used depends on the exact circumstance. Here are some of the most important methods: --- * **Parallax**: Earth orbits the sun. In the process of this orbit, we change our position in space relative to a celestial body Using trigonometry, we can calculate the distance to the celestial body in question. * Advantages: very precise for close objects, no complicated instruments needed. * Disadvantage: only possible for close objects --- * **Spectral emission**: Stars emit photons with specific wavelengths based on the material they are fusing in their core. We can identify the composition of a star by analyzing those photons. Due to the expansion of space, however, the wavelengths of photons emitted very far away get redshifted. That means, their wavelengths get longer the further they travel. By comparing the wavelengths of the photons we *measure* to the wavelengths the photons *should have* we can calculate the distance those photons traveled. And thus the distance to the celestial body. * Advantage: Possible over longer distances * Disadvantage: The object has to be bright enough so we can measure spectral lines reliably --- * **Standard candles**: Standard candles are celestial bodies of known luminosity . We know this luminosity due to the characteristics of some bodies By comparing the absolute brightness to the apparent brightness we can calculate the distance to the standard candle. By identifying standard candles in distant galaxies and nebulae, we can infer the distance of those structures. * Advantage: Possible over long distances * Disadvantage: We need to find standard candles ---",我們如何測量空間？,有幾種計算天體距離的方法。使用哪一個取決於確切的情況。以下是一些最重要的方法：---***視差**：地球繞太陽繞。在這個軌道的過程中，我們使用三角學改變了相對於天體的空間位置，我們可以計算到相關天體的距離。*優點：非常精確的近距離物體，不需要復雜的儀器。*缺點：僅適用於關閉對象----***光譜發射**：星星根據其融合在核心中的材料的特定波長發射光子。我們可以通過分析這些光子來識別恆星的組成。然而，由於空間的膨脹，發射很遠的光子的波長被紅移了。這意味著，它們的波長越多，它們的行進越遠。通過比較我們 *測量 *的光子的波長與光子 *應該 *的波長，我們可以計算這些光子傳播的距離。因此，與天體的距離。*優勢：可能在較長距離的可能性 *缺點：該物體必須足夠明亮，以便我們可以可靠地測量光譜線--- * * *標準蠟燭**：標準蠟燭是已知光度的天體。我們知道，由於某些身體的特徵，我們知道這種光度通過將絕對亮度與明顯的亮度進行比較，我們可以計算到標準蠟燭的距離。通過識別遙遠星系和星雲中的標準蠟燭，我們可以推斷出這些結構的距離。*優勢：長距離可能 *缺點：我們需要找到標準蠟燭---

Why do colors combine to make other colors?,"Colors are a response your brain makes to picking up certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation striking receptor cells in your brain. When this happens, those cells send signals to your brain, and your brain creates the image. Certain combinations of stimulation on those cells cause your brain to generate different colors, to help further discriminate, because this is a beneficial evolutionary adaptation . Color itself is not a property of light or anything. Rather, a product of your brain interpreting it.",為什麼顏色結合起來製作其他顏色？,顏色是您大腦對大腦中電磁輻射受體細胞的某些波長的反應。發生這種情況時，這些細胞向您的大腦發送信號，並且您的大腦會創建圖像。這些細胞刺激的某些組合會導致您的大腦產生不同的顏色，以進一步歧視，因為這是一種有益的進化適應性。顏色本身不是光或任何事物的屬性。相反，您的大腦的產物可以解釋它。
How does electronic currency mining work?,"Simplified, with bitcoin, the ""coins"" are a long chain of solutions to a convoluted math problem. Each coin has to be discovered mathematically by computing out the problem, and it's designed so that each new coin's problem is harder than the one before, and that only a set number of coins will be discovered. After that, the coins are to be used as currency. Until then, as long as each coin is valuable enough, there's money to be made by devoting lots of computers to working through the problem to find the next coins. That's bitcoin mining.",電子貨幣開採如何工作？,簡化的，使用比特幣，“硬幣”是解決複雜的數學問題的一系列解決方案。每個硬幣都必須通過計算問題來數學地發現，並且設計為每個新硬幣的問題都比以前更難，並且只會發現一定數量的硬幣。之後，將硬幣用作貨幣。在此之前，只要每個硬幣足夠有價值，就可以通過專門用於解決問題來找到下一個硬幣來賺錢。那是比特幣開採。
why is the Wilhelm scream so overused in movies?,"It's an inside joke/running gag. Sound mixing is a very tedious job, so they like to have fun. Like how Pixar movies almost have ""A113"" in their movies.",為什麼威廉的尖叫聲在電影中如此過度使用？,這是一個內部的笑話/跑步插科打。聲音混合是一項非常乏味的工作，因此他們喜歡玩得開心。就像皮克斯電影在電影中幾乎具有“ A113”的方式一樣。
"When dieting and losing weight, is there a universal right way? Also do cravings mean something? And other ?","The right way is to utilize more calories than you consume. All diets that succeed do this, all diets that fail, fail to do this. People may be more or less effective at eating less calories, or at burning more, but the equation is always the same. It is possible that combinations of foods make you feel better or worse and that these things enable you to stick with it more. It is certainly healthy to avoid HF corn syrup in general, but from a pure weight loss perspective it is not all that important. Cravings can certainly happen with sugar swings, but again thats about your ability to sustain a pattern of reduced calorie intake and increased calorie burning. Eat the right number of calories. Then eat a good balance of foods. Exercise. That's the recipe for both health and weight loss.",節食和減肥時，是否有一種普遍的正確方法？渴望也意味著什麼？和別的 ？,正確的方法是利用比消耗更多的卡路里。所有成功的飲食都可以做到這一點，所有失敗的飲食都無法做到這一點。人們可能或多或少地在減少卡路里或更多的燃燒方面有效，但方程總是相同的。食物的組合可能會使您感覺好壞，這些東西使您能夠更堅持它。一般而言，避免HF玉米糖漿肯定是健康的，但是從純粹的減肥角度來看，這並不是那麼重要。糖波肯定會發生渴望，但同樣，這又是關於您維持減少卡路里攝入量和增加卡路里燃燒模式的能力。吃正確數量的卡路里。然後吃良好的食物。鍛煉。這就是健康和體重減輕的秘訣。
"Why ""Gravity"" Does Not Exist","Newton said gravity is a mysterious force that affects everything with mass. He didn't know what causes this force but he did create some useful equations. Then Einstein came up with General Relativity. He says that mass bends space-time and that's why things are attracted to each other. For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea. This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't .",為什麼“重力”不存在,牛頓說，重力是一種神秘力量，會影響質量的一切。他不知道是什麼原因導致這種力量，但他確實創建了一些有用的方程式。然後，愛因斯坦提出了一般相對論。他說，彌撒彎腰時空，這就是為什麼事物彼此吸引的原因。例如，如果您將2個重球放在蹦床上，它們會彎曲蹦床並彼此相互移動。這只是一個類比，但它有助於您為這個想法。這種時空的扭曲具有其他副作用，這使得一般相對論可以預測和解釋牛頓定律沒有的事情。
"Some genes, increase the likelihood of getting certain diseases (like cancer) why?","It's kind of misleading to think of the gene as being exclusively for cancer-causing purposes. Typically the ""cancer genes"" people talk about are variations on a gene that codes for sometime useful. Like when people say they have the BRCA1 gene , they don't actually mean they have a genetic sequence in a place where everyone else has nothing. Everyone has a BRCA1 gene, it's just that normally it codes for tumor-suppressing proteins. In people with certain mutations in that region, however, the proteins that it codes for are not produced correctly and thus do not properly suppress the uncontrolled growth of cellsYou 've just opened a can of worms I 've avoided all my life. So, ""cancer genes"" are usually involved in the replication process of DNA. Simply put, the proteins they produce can promote replication, inhibit it or stop mitosis to fix errors that occured in the process. Alterations in these genes can cause uncontrolled replication which makes it VERY prune to errors and increases the chances of it becoming dysplastic and eventually becoming anaplastic .",一些基因增加了某些疾病（例如癌症）的可能性？,認為該基因僅用於癌症的目的是一種誤導。通常，人們談論的“癌症基因”是對有時有用的基因的變化。就像人們說他們擁有BRCA1基因時一樣，它們實際上並不意味著他們在其他所有人都沒有的地方擁有遺傳序列。每個人都有一個BRCA1基因，只是它通常編碼為腫瘤抑制蛋白的代碼。但是，在該地區某些突變的人中，它代碼的蛋白質未正確產生，因此無法正確抑制Cellsyou'v ve的不受控制的生長，只是打開了一罐蠕蟲，我一生都避免了。因此，“癌基因”通常參與DNA的複製過程。簡而言之，它們產生的蛋白質可以促進複製，抑制它或停止有絲分裂以固定在此過程中發生的錯誤。這些基因的改變會導致不受控制的複制，從而使其非常修剪錯誤，並增加了其發育不良並最終成為主體的機會。

There are a few things that seem to do a few but not all of these processes, like viruses, which is why they're classified as nonlife or as some kind of intermediate gray area between life and nonlife. We don't necessarily ""know"" nonlife mutated into life sometime in the past, but we view it as the most likely scenario because we do know that the Earth once had no life, and now, today, it does have life, and also because we know the processes it would have to undergo are theoretically possible.",生活的定義是什麼？,所有已知的生活都有一些共同點，有機體具有這些共同點：它們由一個或細胞組成，經歷新陳代謝，維持穩態，成長，對刺激作用並繁殖。似乎有幾件事似乎做了一些事情，但並非所有這些過程，例如病毒，這就是為什麼它們被歸類為非生命或生活與非生命之間的某種中間灰色區域的原因。我們不一定“知道”過去的某個時候變成生活的非生活，而是我們將其視為最有可能的情況，因為我們確實知道地球曾經沒有生命，現在，現在，它確實有生命，也有生命因為我們知道必須經歷的過程在理論上是可能的。

"Why does good cellphone service/4G come and go, even in the exact same location.","Could be a number of reasons. Most commonly: 1. That is because cell coverage is a ""breathing"" network. As more people use the tower the less power an antenna can allocate for you so the coverage shrinks. As people log off or move out the more power an antenna has and the better your service will be. This is especially true if there is rough terrain between you and the tower. 2. Your between two towers or two ""sectors"" aka antennas of the same tower. You could constantly handing off between two towers which causes your tower to fluctuate. Also if your between two antennas the same hand off occurs. The more antennas and or towers that can talk to you the higher the noise floor or pollution and the less good signal you get. 3. The tower your at isn't maintained well.

Distillation as it pertains to alcoholic drinks,"Once the liquid that they are making the liquor out of has been fermented, and has alcohol in it, then the alcohol needs to be concentrated. Alcohol has a slightly lower boiling point than water, so they heat the liquid to just below the boiling point of water. The alcohol boils off while the majority of the water remains liquid, separating the two. The alcohol vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a more concentrated and higher proof liquid. Then they generally age it in a barrel.",蒸餾與酒精飲料有關,一旦將液體從用來的液體就開始發酵，並在其中含酒精，則需要將酒精濃縮。酒精的沸點比水略低，因此將液體加熱到水的沸點下方。酒精會沸騰，而大多數水則保持液體，將兩者分開。然後將酒精蒸氣冷卻並冷凝回到更濃縮和更高的液體中。然後，他們通常會在桶中衰老。
Are magnets just found or does man make them be what they are? How does this happen?,"Both, magnets occur naturally and we can make them. So electrons are like fanbois and ~~neutrons~~ protons are like hot babes. The bois orbit in the friend zone of the babes, never getting too close, never getting too far away either. If a bunch of babes and their bois go to a mall, and there's a sword outlet on one end and a Victoria's Secret on the other end, then the bois are going to generally head towards the sword outlet, and away from the lingerie shop due to embarassment. At this point, if someone shoots a size-Large anime T-shirt into the front of the crowd and the fanbois start to excitedly pass it around and it swiftly gets passed towards the sword outlet. This is what we call magnetism. Now sometimes the fanbois happen to be arranged nicely, such as in the food court. This is natural magnetism, and generally what you see in ferromagnetism . Sometimes you have a Victoria's Secret nearby and this is called induced magentism or paramagnetism. Now sometimes everyone is randomly scattered around but you have some bro dudes walk by that the babes are attracted to but the fanbois try to get in the way. After the bros leave, the fanbois are still standing in the same spot, and this can be an example of magnetic domains, or using magnets to create more magnets.

Why do we cover railway tracks with rocks ? Does it improve the stability when a train goes by ? (due to the vibrations),"Although it doesn't look it, the ballast is pretty solid. It distributes the load from the passing trains, keeps down unwanted vegetation and enables water to drain away. This last one is very important. Where I live, there was some flooding back in May, and parts of the railway line were submerged. The water, having just washed down from the hillsides, was very muddy, and so the ballast is caked in mud. And so right now the line is closed for a couple of weeks while they clean the ballast. This is because the mud is preventing the water from draining away properly. In the winter, the wet mud would likely freeze, and water expands when it freezes: and so it might actually lift the tracks slightly. If we have a winter where the ballast freezes, unfreezes and freezes again a few times, that could loosen the tracks and make them dangerous.To my knowledge. Its actually to help deal with water. the rocks make it really hard for water to pool around the tracks and help to prevent moisture damage and in some environment ice build upThe rail ties sit on the rocks to distribute the weight of the train. It goes like this. Train wheels distribute to the rail, which spreads the weight to several ties, which distribute the weight to a larger ground area. The rocks help disperse the weight to a greater area rather than just the footprint of the tie.",為什麼我們用岩石覆蓋鐵軌？火車駛過時會提高穩定性嗎？（由於振動）,儘管看起來不像它，但鎮流器非常穩定。它從通行的火車上分配負載，避開不需要的植被，並使水排幹。最後一個非常重要。我居住的地方，五月份發生了一些洪水，鐵路線的某些部分被淹沒了。剛從山坡上沖下來的水很泥濘，因此壓載物被泥被泥漿。因此，目前，線路在清潔鎮流器時關閉了幾個星期。這是因為泥漿阻止水正確排出。在冬季，濕泥可能會凍結，並且水在冷凍時會膨脹：因此，它實際上可能會稍微抬起軌道。如果我們有一個冬天，鎮流器會凍結，解凍和凍結幾次，那可能會放鬆軌道並使它們危險。實際上是為了幫助處理水。這些岩石使水很難在軌道上泳池，並有助於防止水分損壞，在某些環境中，冰層建立在岩石上，以分配火車的重量。它是這樣的。火車輪分配到軌道上，將重量擴散到多個領帶，將重量分配到更大的地面區域。岩石有助於將重量分散到更大的區域，而不僅僅是領帶的足跡。
Why at high speeds on a highway with the window down create s fast pulsating air sound?,"Have you ever blown air over the top of a bottle and made that cool ""hum"" noise? If so, I'm sure you 've noticed, the tone gets higher pitched with a smaller bottle, or with more liquid in it. The same thing is happening in your car, only on a much larger scale, which is why the tone is so low . The window is open, acting like the opening of a bottle. The rest of the car is essentially sealed and mostly empty inside, acting like a container. Travel the right speed with the window open the right amount, and that reverberation will occur just like you were blowing the right speed over the mouth of a bottle. The technical reason this happens is because air pressure drops as relative speed increases. The air inside your car is ""not moving"" and is ""high pressure"", while the air outside is moving at whatever speed the car is, and is relatively ""low pressure"". Basically, the air outside sucks out some of the air inside, which makes it speed up, which drops the pressure, which makes some of the air outside come in, before repeating over and over and over.",為什麼在高速公路上的高速窗戶下方會產生快速脈動的空氣聲？,您是否曾經把空氣吹過瓶頂的頂部，並發出了涼爽的“嗡嗡聲”噪音？如果是這樣，我敢肯定您會注意到，音調越來越高，用較小的瓶子或更多的液體變化。您的汽車中發生了同樣的事情，只有更大的規模，這就是為什麼音調如此之低的原因。窗戶是打開的，就像瓶子的開口一樣。汽車的其餘部分基本上密封，大部分是空的，就像容器一樣。在窗戶打開窗戶的情況下，正確的速度將速度打開，並且混響將發生，就像您在瓶子的口上吹起正確的速度一樣。這發生的技術原因是，隨著相對速度的增加，氣壓下降。汽車內部的空氣是“不移動的”，是“高壓”，而外部空氣以汽車為任何速度的空氣移動，並且相對“低壓”。基本上，外面的空氣吸收了內部的一些空氣，這使其加快了，這會降低壓力，這使得外界的某些空氣進來，然後一遍又一遍地重複。
Why does it take longer to develop professional baseball players than professional football or basketball players?,"The average length of a professional baseball player's career is longer than that of an NBA or NFL player, largely because the athletic skills needed don't drop off as dramatically once the player gets into their mid to late 20s.

how come there is thunder/lightning during storms but during blizzards/snowstorms there is no thunder?,"Actually, there is! [See this!] That said, the reason you don't usually hear thunder during snowstorms is because snow actually suppresses the sound! It basically absorbs it, since it's just fluff in the air, drastically reducing the distance it can be heard! While a regular thunderstorm can be heard for miles and miles, a thundersnow is limited to just 2-3 miles of sound. As for why it's so rare to see a storm like that? You need moisture in the air to produce a thunderstorm. In the summer this is easy, as warm air holds water better. Unfortunately, or fortunately, cold air holds less moisture, and as a result you need special conditions for thundersnow. A warm, wet front trailing or leasing a cold front can produce it.

Power button on a smart phone,"I suggest that you read a few button tutorials for embedded systems like arduino or raspberry pi. The processor can read the state of the buttons at any time. So they do this in a loop. When they notice the button is pressed they start a timer and wait for the button to be released. By measuring the time it takes for you to release the button they can do different functions. To save on battery they might not do it in a loop but rather have an interrupt logic in place that will signal the CPU whenever the state of a button changes and make it run the button checking logic. There may also be additional logic on the circuit board that detects if the power button have been held down for some time without the CPU reacting and do certain functions like toggling the power. This can be useful if the CPU have crashed or if the device is out of powerIt is worth noting that a smartphone power button is not a physical on/off switch like a typical light switch, but instead something more akin to the key of a keyboard - when you press the button a piece of software in the phone registers this and then performs the appropriate task, which can be programmed to be different depending on how long the software determines the button is pressed.Software. If the button wasn't pressed on the previous time, but is now, save the time. If the button was released and press time was < 1 second, turn off the screen.

If the button is still being pressed after 5 seconds, perform a shutdown.",智能手機上的電源按鈕,我建議您閱讀一些針對Arduino或Raspberry Pi等嵌入式系統的按鈕教程。處理器可以隨時讀取按鈕的狀態。所以他們在循環中這樣做。當他們注意到按下按鈕時，他們會啟動一個計時器，然後等待按鈕釋放。通過測量您釋放可以執行不同功能的按鈕所需的時間。為了節省電池，他們可能不會在循環中進行操作，而是具有中斷的邏輯，每當按鈕的狀態更改並使其運行按鈕檢查邏輯時，該邏輯會發出信號。電路板上還可能還有其他邏輯，可以檢測到電源按鈕是否已固定了一段時間，而無需CPU反應，並且執行某些功能（例如切換電源）。如果CPU崩潰了，或者該設備不合時間值得注意，這可能很有用 - 按下按鈕時，手機中的一件軟件會註冊此軟件，然後執行適當的任務，可以將其編程為不同的，具體取決於軟件確定按鈕的時間。如果以前的時間沒有按下按鈕，但是現在是節省時間。如果釋放按鈕並且發行時間<1秒，請關閉屏幕。如果該按鈕仍在按下並且到目前為止超過1秒鐘以上，請顯示關閉屏幕。如果5秒鐘後仍在按下按鈕，請執行關閉。
Why are most holiday messages depersonalized?,"It's so that the card won't be limited to being from a single person or a group. ""Wishing you a happy holiday"" can come from either your single brother or from both your grandparents. If it said ""I wish you a happy holiday,"" groups and couples wouldn't buy that one, and vice-versa. So the company that makes the cards would have to make multiple versions of the card. That incurs additional expense-- and, simply due to chance and demographics, one version would outsell the others, so they would have to try and calculate how much that discrepancy would be, in order to not produce not enough or too many of each one. Much easier to just make them more generic, so they make sense coming from either individuals or groups. The people giving the card can add personal messages that make any vagueness clear, anyway.",為什麼大多數假日消息都會逐步化？,這樣一來，該卡就不會局限於一個人或一個團體。“祝您度假快樂”可以來自您的單身兄弟或兩個祖父母。如果說“我祝您度假快樂，”團體和夫妻不會買那個，反之亦然。因此，製作卡的公司必須製作多個版本的卡。這會產生額外的費用 - 僅由於機會和人口統計學，一個版本將超出其他版本，因此他們必須嘗試計算這種差異的數量，以便不產生不足或每個人的差異。使它們更容易使它們更加通用，因此它們來自個人或群體。無論如何，提供卡的人都可以添加個人消息，使任何模糊性清晰。
Why do people use American Express credit cards?,"American Express is a very Customer-Oriented card program. The individuals that actually carry and use the card love it, generally speaking. Many merchants, of course, hate it. However, there are a few merchants that do like taking AmEx, even though the commission is higher. AmEx is more like a ""Club"" card than a regular credit card. On the opposite end of the scale, ""Visa"" is accepted by almost every business in the world -- even your Sister -- Ummm that's a joke :) AmEx is far better, in my experience, at rewarding brand loyalty. My current AmEx has no fees, anywhere in the world -- no exchange fees, no ATM fees, no telephone call fees. Every time I rent a car with the card, I'm fully covered, even to the point of having a car delivered directly to where I'm standing within 12 hours. I had a strange charge on the card one time. I called the AmEx service desk. I told the rep that I had a strange charge on the card that I did not think was accurate, and I will explain it to you ""SHHHH! Mr. Speedy1! You don't need to explain anything. We don't want you to waste your own time. The charge is coming off the card this very instant! If the hotel doesn't like it, then they can go pound sand!"" I swear that I have never spent more than One Minute -- yes, 60 seconds -- on the phone with AmExWhen I signed up for my American Express card I got 3% cashback automatically deposited into a savings account that earned 5% interest. Not a bad deal. Since then the economy has taken a dump and the card no longer offers that benefit, but I hesitate to switch because it helps my credit by having such an old account.",人們為什麼使用美國快速信用卡？,American Express是一個非常面向客戶的卡計劃。一般而言，實際上攜帶和使用卡的個人喜歡它。當然，許多商人討厭它。但是，即使委員會更高，也有一些商人喜歡參加Amex。Amex更像是一張“俱樂部”卡，而不是常規信用卡。在規模的另一端，“簽證”被世界上幾乎所有業務（甚至是姐姐）所接受，嗯，這是個玩笑：:) Amex在我的經驗中，在獎勵品牌忠誠度方面要好得多。我目前的Amex無需費用，世界上任何地方都沒有 - 沒有兌換費，沒有ATM費用，沒有電話費。每次我用卡租車時，我都會完全覆蓋，甚至直接將汽車直接運送到我站在12小時內的地方。我有一次在卡上有一個奇怪的費用。我打電話給Amex Service Desk。我告訴代表，我在卡上有一個奇怪的費用，我認為不准確，我會向您解釋：“ shhhh！speedy1先生！要浪費自己的時間。這筆費用將非常瞬間從卡上掉下來！如果酒店不喜歡它，那麼他們可以砸沙子！”我發誓，我從來沒有用超過一分鐘的時間（是的，60秒）在電話上與Amexs上簽署了我的美國運通卡，我將3％的現金返還自動存入了儲蓄帳戶，該帳戶獲得了5％的利息。不錯。從那時起，經濟就已經進行了轉儲，該卡不再提供好處，但是我猶豫不決，因為它通過擁有這樣的舊帳戶來幫助我的信用。
Why does inbreeding increase the likelihood of birth defects?,"Everybody has bad genes in them - I remember a scientist quipping that there are enough genetic defects in the human genome to kill a person several times over. However, all humans get two sets of genes, one from each parent. As a result, many of the 'defects' you might have in your genes are simply overridden by the working copy you got from your other parent. However, when you inbreed, you've got two people with very similar genetics, which means that its more likely that they'll both have identical copies of a defective gene . That means the offspring is more likely to receive both copies of the defect from their parents, losing that protection that normally came from receiving two sets of chromosomes. Do not that inbreeding doesn't increase rates of mutations, just the likelihood of genetic defects that are already existing in the parents being expressed fully. Also, this question gets asked a lot. Use the search bar next time.",為什麼近親繁殖會增加出生缺陷的可能性？,每個人都有不良的基因 - 我記得一個科學家打趣，人類基因組中有足夠的遺傳缺陷來殺死一個人多次。但是，所有人類都會獲得兩組基因，一個來自每個父母。結果，您可能在基因中可能存在的許多“缺陷”被您從其他父母那裡獲得的工作副本所覆蓋。但是，當您近交時，您有兩個具有非常相似的遺傳學的人，這意味著他們更有可能倆都具有有缺陷的基因的相同副本。這意味著後代更有可能從父母那裡獲得兩份缺陷的副本，這通常是由於接受兩套染色體而帶來的保護。不要說近親繁殖不會增加突變率，而只是父母充分錶達的遺傳缺陷的可能性。另外，這個問題得到了很多問。下次使用搜索欄。
Where is all the water going?,"The problem isn't that we're losing water, it's that we're just using clean freshwater faster than it's being replenished.

Is it possible for new major cities in first world countries to emerge and be as populous as the current ones?,"Theoretically, cities build up for many reasons, but a key is economics and demographics. There is a dual causality to these. Cities with good demographic conditions can create good economic opportunities, and vice versa. Basically what you need is economic opportunity, or some major demographic shift. For example, Fort McMurray has increased its population by 10 times in the last 40 years or so. Because there are good jobs there. Also many of florida's fastest growing cities were from Retired people moving in from the north.",第一世界國家的新主要城市是否有可能像目前的城市一樣出現並像人口一樣多嗎？,從理論上講，城市的建設是出於許多原因，但關鍵是經濟學和人口統計。這些有雙重因果關係。人口良好的城市可以創造良好的經濟機會，反之亦然。基本上，您需要的是經濟機會或一些重大的人口轉變。例如，在過去40年左右的時間裡，麥克默里堡的人口增加了10倍。因為那裡有好工作。而且，佛羅里達州發展最快的許多城市也來自北部退休的人們。

Why does our body seem like it's exhausted when we oversleep?,"REM cycles. You oversleep, and your body's internal clock gets screwed up so it rolls over to the next cycle and thinks you need to sleep. We need sleep to give our bodies time to repair without need for action, so they can do it freely and easily. Studies have shown that we can also solve problems we were thinking up the day before during sleep.

How does the numbering on interstate exits work?,"Varies by state In some states, the exit corresponds with what the mile marker is. So if the exit is at mile marker 25, it's exit 25. In case of multiple exits or new exits added at mile 25, then it's subdivided into exits 25a, 25b, 25c, etc. In other states, the exits go in numerical order for the duration of the highway. There's an ordering system which runs east-west or north-south from lowest to highest. So the first exit is exit 1, second exit is exit 2, and so on til the end. When new exits are added, that's where you see exit 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.",州際公路上退出的編號如何工作？,在某些狀態下，出口與英里標記相對應。因此，如果出口位於英里標記25，則是出口25.如果多個出口或在25英里處添加的新出口，則將其細分為25A，25B，25C等，在其他州，出口按數值順序進行在高速公路期間。有一個訂購系統，從最低到最高，可以運行東西方或南北。因此，第一個出口是出口1，第二出口是出口2，依此類推。當添加新的出口時，您可以看到2A，2B，2C等。

What happens when my eyes focus on my reflection in my phone screen then switch back to the screen?,"The light field that exists in the three dimensional volume between your eyes and your screen contains many different patterns that correspond to different images at different locations. By pointing your eyes in a certain location and adjusting the shape of the natural lens on the front of your eye, you select out only certain light rays in this light field and bring them into focus to form an image on your retina. The light from your face is always reflecting off the screen and reaching your eyes. But if your lenses are shaped such that your focus is aimed at the screen, the light from your face reflecting off the screen is out of focus because it comes from a different depth. Even though the light from your face seems to be coming from the screen, it is actually coming effectively from behind the screen because it is a reflection of a light pattern created in front of the screen. Therefore the light pattern from your face has a different effective distance then the light created by the screen. So you can focus on the distance corresponding to the location of the screen and only see the image created inside the screen, or you can focus farther away on the effective distance of your face and only see your face.",當我的眼睛專注於手機屏幕上的反射然後切換回屏幕時會發生什麼？,眼睛和屏幕之間三維體積中存在的光場包含許多不同的模式，這些模式與不同位置的不同圖像相對應。通過將眼睛指向特定位置並調節眼前的天然鏡頭的形狀，您只需在此光場中選擇某些光線，並將其焦點放在視網膜上形成圖像。臉上的光總是反射屏幕並伸向您的眼睛。但是，如果您的鏡頭的形狀使您的焦點瞄準了屏幕，那麼反射屏幕的臉部的光將不在焦點，因為它來自不同的深度。即使您的臉上的光似乎來自屏幕，但實際上它是從屏幕後面有效出現的，因為它反映了屏幕前在屏幕前創建的光圖案。因此，與屏幕創建的光相比，您臉上的光圖案具有不同的有效距離。因此，您可以專注於與屏幕位置相對應的距離，並且只能看到屏幕內創建的圖像，也可以將其聚焦在臉部有效距離上，而只能看到您的臉。
How do computers built inside minecraft out of blocks work?,"Computers are essentially huge state machines.

A random mutation occurs. 2.

How do blind people know they are gay?,"They know they are gay because they feel attracted to members of the same gender as themselvesI honestly thought this was a stupidass question at first, but after thinking about it, are we really attracted to anything other than looks that are varied by sex? Personality can pretty much be the same either way. Maybe the voice as well, but IDK.Body image is not the only thing that determines how attracted you are to someone. Their behavior and personality factor into it as well. So if you're a guy and the way another guy talks or acts is arousing, then you might be gay; no vision required.What you're suggesting is that all people born blind logically should be asexual because they can't be physically attracted to someone because they can't see them. But we can be attracted to smell, voice, personality, touch, many different things. The simplest answer is because much like straight people, they are born that way. It is an instinctual desire. They ""just know"".Its actually a pretty good question because at the Georgia academy for the blind, I don't remember one of those blind people being gay, I wish they could see this thread.",盲人怎麼知道他們是同性戀？,他們知道自己是同性戀，因為他們覺得被與他們自己一樣的性別成員所吸引，誠實地認為這是一個愚蠢的問題，但是在考慮了這一點之後，我們是否真的吸引了除了與性別變化的外觀之外的任何東西？個性幾乎可以是相同的。也許也是聲音，但是idk。BodyImage並不是唯一決定您對某人的吸引力。他們的行為和人格也因其為因素。因此，如果您是一個男人，而另一個人的講話或行為正在引起人們的歡迎，那麼您可能是同性戀。無需任何視力。您建議的是，所有盲目出生的人都應該是無性戀者，因為他們不能被某人物理吸引，因為他們看不到他們。但是我們可以被氣味，聲音，個性，觸摸和許多不同的東西所吸引。最簡單的答案是因為很像直率的人，他們是這樣誕生的。這是本能的慾望。他們“只是知道”。這實際上是一個很好的問題，因為在喬治亞州的盲人學院，我不記得其中一個是同性戀，我希望他們能看到這個線索。

What determines what a planet or other celestial body is made of?,As I have come to understand it it's gravity. more massive elements tend to wind up closer to a solar's center of mass in comparison to the lighter elements.

So once these particles get pulled together in to planets you'll get planets with more heavy elements in the planets closer to the star and the planets with lighter elements further out.,是什麼決定了行星或其他天體是由什麼製成的？,當我了解它時，它是重力。與較輕的元素相比，更大的元素往往更接近太陽能的質量中心。當新興太陽系仍然是粒子云時，這一切就會發生。因此，一旦將這些顆粒拉到行星上，您將獲得行星，行星在行星上更靠近恆星，而行星則更較輕。

"How/Why does cracking a glow stick ""activate"" it?","The ELI5 is this: A glowstick works by mixing two liquids which undergo a chemical reaction that produces light.

"""Click Bait"" sites?","They're obnoxious because their goal is to get as many eyes on their advertisements as possible.

The sites are crappy because there is no reason to spend time making them good if they are never going to have real contentSay there's an ""article"" with a list of things, and the list is a presentation that you have to click the slides through. Each click adds to the web traffic of the site, which makes the value of ad space go up. This answers the second question. They're popping up in crazy amounts of volume because there's money to be made. Advertisers are buying up the rest of the webpage to display ads to people. Advertisers want to reach the most people possible, so they look for websites with lots of web traffic. Because advertisers are trying to get your attention, they'll be as obnoxious as possible.

Why all the hate for Joss Whedon's handling of Black Widow in Avengers: Age of Ultron?,"She got captured and put in a cage by a male villain. Partly because ScarJo got pregnant during filming and they had to write her out of some action scenes, but when the only woman on the team is the one who gets kidnapped and needs a man to rescue her, it seems off. That, combined with the addition of a romantic subplot annoyed people who liked that for once, a female lead in a film didn't need a love story to be cool. Oh, and the line about being sterilized got interpreted by some fans to mean ""Because I can't have kids, I am a monster."" Instead of as ""I can't have kids, because of the horrible things they did to me, which resulted in my being a monster."" Which offended women who thought this meant Whedon was treating women as baby-factories who have no worth unless they are pumping out children. So this, combined with the internet amplifying people's anger and rage, lead to so many angry tweets.Feminism, in theory, is okay but many feminists take it too damn far way too frequently. I was looking at a an article about NASA and their plan to handle people that lose their shit in space . There were at least 50 feminist comments that were complaining about the article because the associated picture showed a woman astronaut. Here's the thing it was former astronaut Lisa Nowak. They didn't feature her because she's a woman, they featured her because she's bat shit crazy, drove hundreds of miles in a diaper, and attempted to kidnap the wife of a fellow astronaut that she was having an affair with. THAT'S why it was her picture, not because it was a woman. Not everything is a gender battle that needs fighting.> In addition to his comedic output, he has been a staunch and vocal supporter of people such as Anita Sarkeesian who have faced systematic campaigns of online harassment.

How is Russia able to afford its current modernization program?,"The available resource right in mainland and doesnt have to import, Russia with its vast land is very resource rich, so it's more cost-effective to self supplying some of the industries, making the product costs lower comparing to other countries. Furthermore, the cost living in Russia is lower than other western countries, although their social welfare isnt as good, but still acceptable in their own standard. And finally, being a somewhat ""dictator ship"", they can easily cut the money at some departments and transfer it to their higher priority one. It's the same with NKorea, where 60% people in starving thread, and still can launch rocket, although quality is questionable.

what is the theory behind juries? Why can't judges just make all the decisions?,"The idea behind juries is that you don't want to turn judges into an elite ruling class that has total power over people. That kind of power is easy to abuse. Plus, laws are supposed to be a reflection of society itself determining what rules it wants to follow, so having ""society itself"", in the form of a jury of the accused's peers, determine whether or not the law was broken seems only fitting.Basically, to get every single case to be treated as unique. Human brains are so hardwired for pattern recognition that we frequently see ones that don't exist . As skilled as judges are, they are not above the most basic human instincts. You might say the same problem applies to juries and you'd be right, but the difference is that members of a jury are selected from the general public whereas judges are all quite close knit. The bias problems that arise are less likely to hold a majority and therefore less likely to hand out unfair judgments.",陪審團背後的理論是什麼？為什麼法官不能只是做出所有決定？,陪審團背後的想法是，您不想將法官變成具有對人完全權力的精英統治階級。這種力量很容易濫用。另外，法律應該反映出社會本身，以確定其要遵循的規則，因此以“社會本身”的形式，以被告的同齡人的陪審團的形式確定法律是否被違反似乎只是合適的。基本上，要使所有案例都被視為獨特。人類的大腦是如此刻密地識別模式識別，以至於我們經常看到不存在的大腦。像法官一樣熟練，它們不僅僅是人類最基本的本能。您可能會說同樣的問題適用於陪審團，您是對的，但區別在於，陪審團的成員是從公眾中選出的，而法官都非常緊密。出現的偏見問題不太可能持有多數席位，因此分發不公平的判斷的可能性較小。

What exactly is zero point energy,"Let's say that you have a ball and it behaves like a particle. From physics, we know that the total energy of the ball is the sum of the kinetic energy and its potential energy When the ball isn't moving, it has a minute amount of KE even though it should not have *any* kinetic energy at all. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle forces it to have a minimum ""inherent"" KE that allows the uncertainty principle to exist. Zero point energy is this ""inherent"" minimal KE, otherwise known as the energy of the ground state. Because of quantum fluctuations due to the HUP, it is impossible for a particle to have no KE at all. Ergo, it is impossible to thermodynamically induce absolute zero. Technically, I shouldn't even be comparing ZPE to KE because it is possible to have no KE and still have ZPE. But for the purposes of this explanation, I will make this mistake. Thus, the total energy of a particle is its KE + PE + ZPE.",零點能量到底是什麼,假設您有一個球，它的行為就像粒子。從物理學來看，我們知道球的總能量是動能的總和及其勢能，當球不移動時，即使它不應該在 *全部。海森伯格的不確定性原則迫使其具有最低限度的“固有” KE，從而使不確定性原理存在。零點能是這種“固有”的最小值，也稱為基態的能量。由於由於HUP而導致的量子波動，因此粒子根本不可能沒有KE。Ergo，無法熱力學誘導絕對零。從技術上講，我什至不應該將ZPE與KE進行比較，因為沒有KE並且仍然具有ZPE。但是出於這種解釋的目的，我將犯這個錯誤。因此，粒子的總能量是其ke + pe + zpe。
How do prisoner exchanges during war actually work?,The reasoning for doing a POW swap are worked out in advance.

How (or why) is the US Federal Reserve not an actual part of the government?,"The Federal Reserve is essentially a government agency that is operated privately.

Why hats used to be so popular in the 1920's and 30's,"Hats have been popular articles of men's attire from ancient times until 1960.

From about 1920 to 1960 men found it increasingly hard to use hats as an article of fashion due to the headroom in cars. As the headroom got smaller, hats got harder to wear. First the large tophat style hats vanished, then even smaller fedoras. About the only place men still feel comfortable wearing headgear in transport is in the cab of large trucks.Yes, this question has almost everything to do with transportation modes. As walking and public transport became the modes for the poor, rich people stopped wearing hats because they are not really needed when you drive your own car.There's some fashion documentaries which are pretty interesting. _URL_0_ Basically fashion used to be very rigid and unrelaxed but historical figures through history have relaxed fashion and the hat took off with it.

Why do omelets and scrambled eggs taste differently even though I put the same ingredients into them?,"First, texture has a lot to do with food. The sensations of chewing, moving food around in your mouth, and taking a bite-sized solid piece of omelet versus a fluffy bit of scrambled egg with a lot of air in it will add to a difference in flavor. Next, your omelet usually has a big chunk of ""other stuff"" in its middle whereas the scrambled egg approach would have little bits of other things all throughout them . This changes the way those additional bits cook and exchange tastes with each other, changes their moisture content, and changes the distribution of flavours that you get in each mouthful. Finally, scrambled eggs are mixed around and they're cooked very uniformly without a ""browned"" exterior, but omelets usually have a little more deep-cooking in their exterior surface, and its different more-burned chemicals can result in a different flavor profile.",煎蛋捲和炒雞蛋的味道也有所不同，即使我將相同的成分放入它們中？,首先，質地與食物有很大關係。咀嚼，在嘴裡移動食物的感覺，以及一口大小的堅固的煎蛋捲，而蓬鬆的炒雞蛋，其中有很多空氣會增加風味的差異。接下來，您的煎蛋捲通常在中間有很多“其他東西”，而炒雞蛋的方法幾乎沒有其他東西。這改變了這些額外的碎片烹飪和交換口味的方式，改變了水分含量，並改變了您在每個口中獲得的口味的分佈。最後，混合了炒雞蛋，它們在沒有“褐色”外部的情況下非常均勻地煮熟，但是煎蛋捲通常在其外部表面煮得更深，並且其不同燃燒的化學物質可能會導致不同的風味。。

How is the speed of the ball measured immediately in sports like cricket?,"They use a radar gun, just like the ones police use. They use the doppler effect to measure speed of the ball. You can buy one at many sporting goods storesA laser is projected at the ball and the delay before it is reflected back is measured. Compare any two data points and you have velocity.",在像板球這樣的運動中，球的速度如何立即測量？,他們使用雷達槍，就像警察使用的槍支一樣。他們使用多普勒效應來測量球的速度。您可以在許多體育用品商店的激光器上購買一個，並在球上預測延遲，然後測量反射後的延遲。比較任意兩個數據點，並且您的速度。
"In today’s society, why is adopting a child not more encouraged than having your own and adding to an already over-populated planet?","Biological drive to reproduce, and societal drive to pass on a family legacy. It's basically that simple.",在當今的社會中，為什麼要收養一個孩子比擁有自己的孩子更受鼓舞的並增加了已經過度人口稠密的星球？,生物學的繁殖和社會驅動力，以傳達家庭遺產。基本上很簡單。
What causes me to have extremely poor facial recognition skills?,"You could have some degree of face blindness, _URL_0_ Which is an issue remembering people by their faces. In person, other cues like their voice, stride, context of meeting, and personality will clue you in, but there is no such benefit from photos.",是什麼使我的面部識別能力極差？,您可能會有一定程度的面部失明，_url_0_是一個問題，記住人們的臉。親自，其他提示等他們的聲音，大步，會議的背景和個性會向您提示，但是照片中沒有這樣的好處。
Why is anal sex called anal sex and not rectal sex? (NSFW),For the same reason oral sex is not called throat sexKnowledge is knowing the difference between the anus & the rectum. Wisdom is not caring that people are going to constantly get them confused.,為什麼肛交稱為肛交而不是直腸性別？（NSFW）,出於相同的原因，口交不稱為喉嚨性知識，就是知道肛門和直腸之間的區別。智慧並不關心人們會不斷使他們感到困惑。
Why don't babies have morning breath?,"I'm guessing it has to do with teeth. Before babies have teeth, there's less surface area for bad breath causing bacteria to cling to, hence no morning breath. Being on a liquid diet probably has something to do with it too.",嬰兒為什麼不呼吸早晨？,我猜這與牙齒有關。在嬰兒有牙齒之前，口臭的表面積較小，導致細菌緊貼，因此沒有早晨的呼吸。進行液體飲食可能也與之有關。
Why does it hurt so much to get kicked in the balls?,"Evolutionarily, our whole purpose in life is to live long enough to raise children, our genes don’t really care what happens after that. Our entire pain/reward system has been tweaked to this purpose. You ate? Good job, here is some dopamine. You skinned your knee? Bad job, that could get infected and kill you have some pain. Based on this logic, pretty much the worst thing you could do is damage your ability to reproduce, so your balls are absolutely packed with nerve endings that will send intense pain signals to your brain if they sense injury, because losing your reproductive ability is equally as bad as death.Because you are hitting an exposed organ that is virtually outside of the body. I'm sure getting hit directly on any other organ would hurt just as much if not more.Things that don't reproduce die out, so the species that exist today are species that are good at reproduction, by process of elimination. Natural selection has selected for ""being good at making more yous."" If your balls get ruined, you can't make more yous. If it was easy to get to the point where you couldn't make more yous, you probably wouldn't exist by now, or not exist for much longer. So the body is *very* adverse to ball damage. I might go so far as to say all of human civilization, art, and science, is a fancy carrying case for sperm.",為什麼踢球會這麼痛苦？,從進化上講，我們人生的全部目的是要活得足夠長以養育孩子，我們的基因並不真正在乎那之後會發生什麼。我們的整個痛苦/獎勵系統已針對此目的進行了調整。你吃？幹得好，這裡有一些多巴胺。你給膝蓋剝皮了嗎？不好的工作，這可能會被感染並殺死您有些痛苦。基於這種邏輯，您可能要做的最糟糕的事情是損害您的繁殖能力，因此您的球絕對充滿了神經結尾，如果他們感受到受傷，會給您的大腦發出強烈的疼痛信號，因為失去生殖能力同樣是同樣的因為您正在擊中實際上在身體外面的裸露器官。我敢肯定，直接受到任何其他器官的攻擊會造成同樣多的傷害。自然選擇是為了“善於創造更多您”。如果您的球被毀了，您將無法做更多的您。如果很容易到達您無法獲得更多您的地步，那麼您現在可能不存在，或者不存在更長的時間。因此，身體對球損傷非常不利。我可能會說，所有人類文明，藝術和科學都是精子的奇特攜帶案例。
What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?,"Most everything has chemical reactions as they age. Some medications get weaker so the medicine simply stops working correctly. Some become more powerful so you risk overdose. And some completely change and can either lose their effect or become toxic.They don't become unsafe for consumption at their expiration date, that is just the date at which they're guaranteed that they haven't degraded in terms of potency you could take Tylenol that's a year expired and it's safe, but might only be 90% as effective.Medicines are usually organic materials which break down over time and when stored at high temperatures they break down even faster.They don’t become unsafe, the active ingredient just gets less and less so they no longer serve the purpose for which they were created', ""So, this is why my doctor has me store my bi-polar/manic medication in the freezer - it's just for emergencies and might not be taken for years.",除了到期日期，他們不安全地消費會發生什麼？,隨著年齡的增長，大多數一切都有化學反應。有些藥物會變得較弱，因此該藥物只是停止正常工作。有些變得更強大，因此您有過度服用過量。有些人完全改變了，可能會失去效果或有毒。它們在到期日的消費日期不安以一年過期的泰諾（Tylenol成分越來越少，因此它們不再滿足其創造的目的”，“因此，這就是為什麼我的醫生讓我將雙極/躁狂藥物存儲在冰箱中 - 僅是出於緊急情況而不是花了多年。
how are people in many societies expected to find love and marry by their early 20s?,"Basically, when everyone is aware they must be married by 21, people compromise and settle quickly. Some of the prettiest or most socially dominant people in highschool would have first pick, then their friends would feel the need to catch up, and so on, until very nearly everyone had someone just because it's not fashionable not to. Imagine if you could only ever sleep with your highschool prom date ever again, and if you didn't have one, that was it, you would have to go become a monk. You would imagine that a lot of people would make do with a decent prom date, and that sometimes people would marry only out of fear of being alone.",人們如何期望在20多歲時找到愛與結婚的人們？,基本上，當每個人都知道他們必須結婚21歲時，人們會妥協並迅速解決。在高中，一些最漂亮或最有社會的人是第一次選擇，那麼他們的朋友會覺得需要趕上，依此類推，直到幾乎每個人都有一個人，只是因為不時尚而沒有。想像一下，如果您只能再次與高中舞會約會一起睡覺，如果您沒有一個，那就是這樣，您就必須成為和尚。您可能會想像，很多人會在一個體面的舞會約會中做到，有時人們只出於害怕一個人而嫁給。
Why is Ellen Pao hated?,"Since the subreddit ban wave reddit decided she was satan, and never really came back from that. Some people believe she's commercializing reddit and steering it away from its roots. Personally I don't think we have the information to read her character one way or the other.",為什麼艾倫·鮑（Ellen Pao）討厭？,自從Subreddit Ban Wave Reddit決定自己是撒旦，但從未真正回來過。有些人認為她正在商業化Reddit，並將其遠離根源。就我個人而言，我認為我們沒有信息以一種或另一種方式閱讀她的角色。
Grafite and diamond are made of the same thing. Why one is transparent and other not?,"In a diamond, the carbon atoms are all neatly lined up in a crystaline structure. Photons entering the lattice work from the right angles will pass right through it virtually unimpeded. In graphite and other forms of carbon, the lattice work isn't there, and the atoms are in what you'd call a pile. So photons encounter resistance no matter where they hit it.",石墨和鑽石是由同一件事製成的。為什麼一個人是透明的，另一個是透明的？,在鑽石中，碳原子全都在晶體結構中整齊排列。從直角進入晶格工作的光子幾乎沒有受到阻礙。在石墨和其他形式的碳中，晶格工作不存在，原子在您所說的堆中。因此，無論擊中何處，光子都會遇到阻力。
How can you identify musical meter?,"Other repetitive patterns, such as loudness of notes, in pop music, bass and snare drum hits are closely synced to the meter. Listen for arpeggios on bass, guitars or pianos that are multiples of the meter. If music is less rhythmic, like just long slow legato notes on violins or synth pads, it will be harder to recognize. There is a less emphasized ""downbeat"" for you to find",您如何識別音樂儀？,流行音樂，貝斯和圈套鼓擊中中的其他重複模式，例如音符的響度，與儀表緊密同步。聽貝司，吉他或鋼琴上的雜物，這些雜物是儀表的倍數。如果音樂的節奏較低，就像長時間的慢腿腿上的音符在小提琴或合成墊上的音符一樣，很難識別。您找到的“沮喪”不太強調
How do bees make such perfect hexagons?,"That is just what happens when you cram a bunch of circles together. Bees make circular/cylindrical containers for their honey and eggs, since those have the most volume to wall material ratio. When these are all smushed together you get hexagons.",蜜蜂如何製造如此完美的六邊形？,當您將一堆圓圈塞在一起時，這就是發生的事情。蜜蜂為其蜂蜜和雞蛋製作圓形/圓柱容器，因為它們的體積最多。當這些都被擊中時，您會得到六角形。
Why have I never heard of someone getting heart cancer?,"It's just a very, very rare form of cancer so it's not heavily talked about. _URL_0_ Apparently the drummer of Kiss died from it, though.",為什麼我從未聽說有人患有心臟癌？,這只是一種非常非常罕見的癌症形式，因此並沒有大量談論。_url_0_顯然，Kiss的鼓手死於它。
Where does the energy go to when you have a fully charged device and it is still plugged into the wall?,"This is how I've been told to think about it: it's not that the power plug is PUSHING power out to the device, it's that the device battery is PULLING power from the plug. When the battery is 'full', it stops PULLING thereby eliminating any further flow of electrons. Can anyone confirm?",當您裝有充滿電的設備並且仍將其插入牆壁時，能量將轉移到哪裡？,這就是我被告知要考慮的方式：這並不是說電源插頭將電源推向設備，而是設備電池從插頭中拔出電源。當電池“滿”電池時，它停止拉動，從而消除了任何進一步的電子流。誰能確認？
What causes a mob mentality?,"It is herd mentality. I nature it goes like ""everyone else is terrified and running away so I should also be terrified and running away"". There for in an angry mob everyone around you is angry, shouting and swearing ect so subconsciously you also feel you should be doing just this. Such mentality, as you called it, causes angry crowds to do things that individuals wouldn't and riots emerge.There sure is! It's called group theory in psychology.Basically, when we see a lot of people doing something, we think it's the thing we should be doing too, even if it's something we wouldn't normally do. We do this because we have an innate desire and need to fit in with society, because we're social creatures. This is evident in the case of flash riots at sporting events, and even in smaller groups when someone offers up a bad idea/suggestion and no one says anything about it, because the person to their left or right nodded in agreement. If other people think it's good and right, then we should, too. For a fun experiment, get your friends together and form a line outside of a business, like a coffee shop. Watch as newcomers and strangers start forming up behind you, even though they could just walk in and be served.Shame is an emotion that prompts us to conform to the group to avoid being exiled. Our affinity to being social was evolutionary wired because an outcast was more likely to be eaten by a predator or have a harder time foraging. In a mob, each individual diffuses responsibility thinking that someone else will likely have the courage to think/act properly. The mob confers a degree of anonymity. Self awareness blends and we start to merge our identity with the group. Any antagonism or deviation gets misconstrued as a personal attack. Group think supplants our own individual critical faculties and the flow of ideas becomes bona fide.",是什麼引起暴民心態？,這是牛群的心態。我的大自然就像是“其他所有人都感到恐懼和逃跑，所以我也應該害怕並逃跑”。在一個生氣的暴民中，每個人周圍的每個人都生氣，大喊大叫和宣誓，所以潛意識您也覺得自己應該這樣做。正如您所說的那樣，這種心態會使憤怒的人群做個人不會的事情，並且會出現騷亂。肯定是！這就是心理學中的群體理論。從基礎上，當我們看到很多人在做某事時，我們認為這也是我們應該做的事情，即使這是我們通常不會做的事情。我們之所以這樣做，是因為我們有天生的願望，需要適應社會，因為我們是社會生物。這在體育賽事中的閃光暴動中很明顯，即使是在較小的小組中，當有人提出一個壞主意/建議時，沒有人對此表示任何意見，因為左派或右邊的人同意了。如果其他人認為這是好事，那麼我們也應該。要進行有趣的實驗，請將您的朋友聚在一起，並在企業外面形成一條線，例如咖啡店。看著新來者和陌生人開始在您身後形成，即使他們可以走進來並得到服務。我們對社交的親和力是進化的連線，因為掠奪者更有可能被捕食者吃掉或覓食更困難。在暴民中，每個人都會分散責任，以為別人可能有勇氣正確地思考/採取行動。暴民賦予一定程度的匿名性。自我意識融合在一起，我們開始將我們的身份與小組合併。任何對抗或偏差都被誤認為是人身攻擊。小組認為，取代我們自己的個人批判能力，思想的流動變得真正。
Why Mexico did not become a powerful nation just like Canada or the US?,"As a Canadian, I think the word you're looking for is *affluent,* not powerful.",為什麼墨西哥不像加拿大或美國那樣成為一個強大的國家？,作為加拿大人，我認為您要尋找的單詞 *富裕， *不強大。
Why can't we freeze food twice?,"This is a myth. You can freeze and re-freeze food as much as you 'd like, because the freezing process kills bacteria. The optimum temperature for bacterial growth is close to body temperature or higher for many bacteria . This is the ""danger zone"". What you don't want to do is refrigerate food over and over again. Or freeze a giant meal, reheat the whole damn thing and let it sit out on the counter for a while, then refreeze the whole damn thing again. If you take a meal out of the refrigerator, heat it a little, then put it back in the refrigerator, you're bringing the temperature up into the ""danger zone"". If you do this over and over again, you allow the bugs to multiply a lot. Freezing rapidly can kill these bacteria. But you also have the risk of the toxins from the bacteria in your food . Check out the [USDA's page regarding leftovers] before Republicans remove it from the website. The best thing you can do is take leftovers as soon as you eat the food and separate them into smaller quantities for freezing. Then only bring out one portion at a time, heat it and eat all of it. Putting it back and forth into the fridge can be dangerous.It's to do with how many times food goes hot to cold/cold to hot. Every time it does the food goes through the optimum temperature zone for bacteria growth. So this increase the chances of I'd poisoning.",為什麼我們不能兩次冷凍食物？,這是一個神話。您可以像您一樣凍結並重新凍結食物，因為凍結過程會殺死細菌。細菌生長的最佳溫度接近體溫或許多細菌的體溫更高。這是“危險區域”。您不想做的是一遍又一遍地冷藏食物。或凍結一頓大餐，將整個該死的東西重新加熱，然後讓它在櫃檯上坐一會兒，然後再次重新凍結整個該死的東西。如果您從冰箱中取出一頓飯，請將其加熱一點，然後將其放回冰箱中，將溫度提升到“危險區域”。如果一遍又一遍地這樣做，則允許錯誤乘以很多。迅速凍結可以殺死這些細菌。但是，您也有食物中細菌毒素的風險。在共和黨人將其從網站上刪除之前，請查看[USDA的頁面關於剩菜的剩菜]。您可以做的最好的事情是，一旦吃食物並將其分成較少的冷凍量，就剩下剩菜。然後一次只帶一部分，加熱並吃掉所有部分。將其來回冰箱可能很危險。這與食物變熱到冷/冷至熱有關。每次使用食物都會穿過最佳溫度區域以實現細菌的生長。因此，這增加了我中毒的機會。
How do some foods make you gassy? Where is the gas coming from?,"Some types of sugar consist of a bunch of different sugar molecules chained together. For example, starch consists of long chains of glucose molecules, and has to be split into single glucose molecules by an enzyme. However, different types of sugar require different enzymes for this job, for example lactose requires an enzyme called lactase, which some people don't have. For some types of sugar however, nobody has the required enzymes. These types of sugar can however be broken down by bacteria in the guts, which use it as an energy source. In doing so, they produce gases.",某些食物如何使您gassy？氣體來自哪裡？,某些類型的糖包括一堆鏈條的不同糖分子。例如，澱粉由葡萄糖分子的長鏈組成，必須通過酶將其分為單個葡萄糖分子。但是，不同類型的糖需要不同的酶來完成這項工作，例如乳糖需要一種稱為乳糖酶的酶，有些人沒有。但是，對於某些類型的糖，沒有人擁有所需的酶。但是，這些類型的糖可以被腸道中的細菌分解，從而將其用作能源。這樣，它們會產生氣體。
The Duluth Model in relation or application to domestic violence,"Basically the Deluth model states that if a domestic violence call occurs then the man gets arrested to ensure safety for the woman. This generally occurs irrespective of who called the police or what the story is when the police get there. The men's lib movement sees this as a very bad thing and in areas where it occurs as described they are correct. However, like most other claims of discrimination in the modern west its impact is overstated in my opinion. It's kind of like quicksand, you probably grew up thinking quicksand was some kind of super death trap yet the mundane reality is that it has very little effect on your life unless you put yourself in specific circumstances for it to become a problem.",Duluth模型有關家庭暴力的關係或應用,基本上，Deluth模型指出，如果發生家庭暴力電話，則該男子將被捕以確保婦女的安全。無論是誰打電話，警察到達那裡時，這通常都會發生這種情況。男子的自由運動認為這是一件非常糟糕的事情，並且在所描述的地區，它們是正確的。但是，我認為，像大多數其他現代西部歧視主張一樣，它的影響被誇大了。這有點像Quicksand，您可能長大後認為Quicksand是某種超級死亡陷阱，但平凡的現實是，它對您的生活幾乎沒有影響，除非您將自己置於特定情況下，以使其成為問題。
What do the reduced salt signs on highways and roads mean?,"Highways are sprayed with a salt solution in winter to prevent the formation of ice. Certain sections of highway are near water supplies and protected wilderness areas however. These sections are salted less in order not to contaminate the surrounding ecosystems. They put the signs up to warn you that because there's less salt, there will likely be more ice.",高速公路和道路上減少的鹽標誌意味著什麼？,高速公路在冬季噴灑鹽溶液，以防止冰的形成。但是，某些部分的高速公路靠近水供應和受保護的荒野區域。這些部分的鹽較少，以免污染周圍的生態系統。他們提出警告，警告您，因為鹽的少量，可能會有更多的冰。
How did Lou reed's Liver fail on him caused by years of drug use and drinking if he has been sober for many years already?,"I am, of course, not Lou Reed's doctor but I'd imagine it's because livers, although very miraculous in their regenerative capabilities in some ways, aren't perfect. As we age our organs, and all of us really, degrades. If it didn't we'd never get old. It's easily possible that he damaged it to a certain threshold way back when, and this threshold was above the functional level, but close to disaster. Then he aged a bit and the damage from years ago caught up with him.Organs fail all the time, and the risk increases as you age. A nondrinker can experience liver failure, and Keith Richards is still alive for some reason. A lot of it has to do with genetic predispositions.",如果盧·里德（Lou Reed）的肝臟已經多年，他多年的吸毒和飲酒導致了他的肝臟如何失敗？,當然，我不是盧·里德（Lou Reed）的醫生，但我想這是因為肝臟在某些方面的再生能力非常奇蹟，但並不完美。隨著我們的器官和我們所有人的年齡，確實會降低。如果不是，我們永遠不會變老。他很容易將其損壞到可以追溯到某個閾值時，而這個門檻高於功能水平，但接近災難。然後他老了一點，幾年前的損害趕上了他。獸人始終失敗，隨著年齡的增長，風險會增加。非疏鬆師可能會遇到肝衰竭，而基思·理查茲（Keith Richards）仍然活著。其中很多與遺傳易感性有關。
Why does travel in a bus/train make me feel tired?,"I believe it's from the constant adjustments your body has to make from being bumped around. You never get the opportunity to sit still like you would on a couch.Stress may also be a factor, in addition to the physiological impacts the others stated. Feeling tired may be as much a mental situation in some cases based upon hormone balances. If you are nervous and view travel per bus/train as nerve-wracking, adrenaline productiob may increase during the experience. When done, instead of pure relief, you also feel more tired.There is a phenomenon called 'place lag,' basically the temporary disorientation of finding yourself in a new place. Your brain need time to catch up and reorient, and that takes resources. Decision fatigue is also an underappreciated part of travel. Making decisions is taxing. It uses up resources. That is why people like to do things like take the same route to work every day. It eliminates the need to make major decisions. Many people have anxiety around travel, over all forms of transportation and destinations. It doesn't have to be as dramatic as a massive fear of flying. It could be things like: Will I have a relaxing holiday? Will my hotel be okay? What if it isn't? Will I be able to find my around? What if something happens? Will everything be okay at home? What if I miss something at work? This sort of thinking is very fatiguing. I seriously question the muscle microadjustments thing. Your body is constantly making adjustments and dealing with gravity and stuff every second of the day, not *only* when you travel.The same is true of planes and cars, at least for me. It may be from sitting in a confined space for an extended period of time. I find travel exhausting, but so worth it.",為什麼在公共汽車/火車上旅行會讓我感到疲倦？,我相信，這是您身體不斷碰撞所做的不斷調整。除了其他人所說的生理影響外，您也永遠沒有機會像在沙發上那樣坐著坐著。在某些情況下，基於激素平衡，感覺疲倦可能是一種精神狀況。如果您緊張並將每輛巴士/火車的旅行視為令人不安的旅行，那麼在體驗期間，腎上腺素的產品可能會增加。完成後，您還會感到更加疲倦，而不是純粹的救濟。您的大腦需要時間來趕上和重新定向，這需要資源。決策疲勞也是旅行的不足部分。做出決定是徵稅。它消耗資源。這就是為什麼人們喜歡做諸如每天沿著同樣的途徑上班之類的事情。它消除了做出重大決定的需求。許多人在旅行周圍有焦慮，在各種形式的運輸和目的地上。它不必像對飛行的巨大恐懼那樣戲劇化。可能是：我會有一個輕鬆的假期嗎？我的酒店會好嗎？如果不是怎麼辦？我可以找到自己的周圍嗎？如果發生了什麼事怎麼辦？家裡一切都會好起來嗎？如果我想念工作中的東西怎麼辦？這種想法非常疲勞。我認真地質疑肌肉麥克雷吉斯的事情。您的身體每天第二秒都在不斷進行調整，並處理重力和東西，而不是 * *當您旅行時 * *，至少對我來說，飛機和汽車也是如此。這可能是由於坐在一個狹窄的空間中長時間坐著。我發現旅行疲憊不堪，但值得。
"If women's cycles sync up when they spend some time together, wouldn't every women be theoretically on the same monthly cycle?","I think they would have to spend a lot more time together than you imagine, like maybe live together and spend a lot of time outside work/college with each other also.",如果婦女的周期在在一起花一段時間時同步，那麼每個女性在同一每月週期中都不會在理論上是不是嗎？,我認為他們將不得不花更多的時間在一起，就像您想像的那樣，也許一起生活，彼此之間花費大量時間。
Why can't they make space elevators with propellers on them to reduce tension forces?,"That would only work in the atmosphere, where the propellers have something to push: air. But the cable will experience the same amount of tension above the atmosphere, where there is no air for the propellers to push. The only real solution is to find a way to manufacture, in large quantity at reasonable cost, a material with the necessary tensile strength.",他們為什麼不能將帶有螺旋槳的太空電梯在上面減少張力？,那隻能在大氣中起作用，螺旋槳有要推的東西：空氣。但是電纜將在大氣上方經歷相同數量的張力，那裡沒有螺旋槳推動的空氣。唯一真正的解決方案是找到一種以合理成本大量製造的方法，一種具有必要拉伸強度的材料。
"How did gold, silver, and bronze specifically become the iconic symbols of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in competitions.","Being both common and given value. Bronze is a mix of copper and On mobile, but I want to say iron. Looks nice, but isnt all that valuable. Silver is more valuable, but tarnishes. Gold is a symbol of wealth and purity, and is the most valuable of the three. Other materials are not as common, harder to work with, or either too valuable to give up, or too cheap to mean anythingEuropeans have used gold, silver and bronze have as coin metals since ancient times. They only really learned about platinum in the 18th and 19th centuries.",黃金，銀和銅如何專門成為比賽中第一，第二和第三的標誌性符號。,既普遍又具有價值。青銅是銅和移動裝置的混合物，但我想說鐵。看起來不錯，但並不是那麼有價值。銀更有價值，但會損害。黃金是財富和純潔的象徵，也是三者中最有價值的。其他材料並不那麼普遍，很難與之合作，要么太有價值而不能放棄，要么太便宜了，以至於歐洲人自古以來就使用了黃金，銀色和銅牌作為硬幣金屬。他們只真正了解了18世紀和19世紀的白金。
Why does clips of American news seem such poor quality on UK TV?,"The UK and the US have two different systems for broadcast TV signals. The US uses a system called NTSC, and the UK uses a system called PAL. PAL is slightly better than NTSC to start with, but converting an NTSC signal to PAL degrades it even further. All the major US networks now broadcast an HDTV signal as well. That should be directly compatible with an HDTV broadcast in the UK and the quality should be indistinguishable. But I have no idea what the agreements are between the US news outlets and the British news outlets to exchange video clips so it may be that whatever source you're using for news is limited to NTSC clips.It is usually footage they found on the Internet posted by somebody that was there. Unless you actually saw a reporter.",為什麼在英國電視台上，美國新聞的剪輯質量如此之差？,英國和美國有兩個不同的廣播電視信號系統。美國使用一個名為NTSC的系統，英國使用了一個名為PAL的系統。PAL比NTSC稍好一些，但是將NTSC信號轉換為PAL會進一步降低。現在，美國所有主要的網絡也廣播了HDTV信號。這應該與英國的HDTV廣播直接兼容，質量應該是無法區分的。但是我不知道美國新聞媒體和英國新聞媒體之間的協議是什麼交換視頻剪輯，因此可能是您用於新聞的任何來源都僅限於NTSC剪輯。互聯網由某人發布。除非您實際上看到了記者。
How is topsoil formed and why does it take so long?,"Soil is formed as leaves and stuff fall, also ferns, but once they fall, detritivores will break down material. Eventually it lets it’s nutrients go down to lower levels of soil O is the organic matter, C is bedrock IIRC.So first off, how many leaves do you think fall in a square foot of land at any given year, because that can be a major limiting factor. Also Temperature and Humidity also play a role, higher temperature gives more energy and water helps to break down and leech nutrients.Soil scientists will dig holes to look at the layers and they can also give a good description of the land. For the USA you can google, web soil survey, and look for a parcel of land that you are interested in and get a report about the predicted soils in your areaBecause soil takes so long to form some states like Idaho have listed it as a public resource, so you can’t do damage to it, in a forestry setting, you can’t run a machine too much on it. Washington kinda protects it, but more on the side, Washington has protections for the fish, which in turn protects the streams with a forested buffer, like 150-200’ wide from the stream bank, and also you can’t let too much sediment get into the stream from logging roads or erosion up stream. The constitution gave states the right to manage their lands, other than national lands, so they have different rules between each state, Washington has one of the bigger rule books.",如何形成表土，為什麼要花這麼長時間？,土壤是葉子和東西掉落的，也形成了蕨類植物，但是一旦它們掉落，碎屑將破壞材料。最終，它可以讓它的營養成分降至較低的土壤o是有機物，C是基岩IIRC。首先，您認為在任何一年的一年主要限制因素。此外，溫度和濕度也起作用，更高的溫度可以提供更多的能量，水有助於分解和水ech養分。土壤科學家將挖洞以查看這些層，它們也可以很好地描述土地。對於美國，您可以使用Google，網絡土壤調查，並尋找您感興趣的一塊土地，並獲得有關您地區土壤中預測土壤的報告，因為土壤需要很長時間才形成像愛達荷州這樣的一些州將其列為公眾資源，因此您不能對其造成損害，在林業環境中，您不能在其上運行太多機器。華盛頓有點保護它，但更多的是，華盛頓對魚有保護，這反過來又可以用森林緩衝液保護溪流，例如150-200'遠離溪流，而且您也不能讓太多的沉積物。從伐木道路或侵蝕溪流中進入溪流。憲法賦予了各州管理其土地的權利，除了國家土地以外，他們在每個州之間都有不同的規則，華盛頓擁有更大的規則書之一。
Why can't we flush toilets with saltwater?,"That would necessitate two different water sources coming to your house and an additional plumbing system to keep your toilet separate from your sinks, showers, etc.It's perfectly possible, however as someone else said a separate piping system is required. Most toilets in Hong Kong are flushed with salt water.We could, but we don't because toilets are connected to the fresh water supply and running salt water through that is a bad idea. Changing that would require separate plumbing which as I'm sure you will understand is hella expensive to install after the fact. There are, by the way, some places where toilets are flushed with some source of ""dirty"" water but it's usually limited to a single buildingBecouse the pipes will rust from the salt water. The reason is that the process of rusting involves electrons moving around, and electrons move more easily in salt-water than they do in clean water. A simple test of this is to see how easily current flows in clean water it does not), and then add salt to the water . :)You would need to install a second seperate plumbing system in your home and have salt water pumping stations and treatment plants. Salt water destroys expensive difficult to maintain machines very quickly.",為什麼我們不能用鹽水沖洗廁所？,這將需要兩種不同的水源來到您的房屋和一個額外的管道系統，以使您的廁所與水槽，淋浴等分開。香港的大多數廁所都用鹽水沖洗。我們可以，但我們不是因為廁所與淡水供應和運行鹽水連接在一起是一個壞主意。更改需要單獨的管道，我敢肯定，您會理解，事後安裝昂貴。順便說一下，在某些地方，廁所被某種“臟”水沖洗，但通常僅限於單個建築物，管道會從鹽水中生鏽。原因是生鏽的過程涉及電子在四處移動，並且電子在鹽水中的移動比在清潔水中更容易移動。對此的簡單測試是，查看流動在乾淨的水中的流動程度如何），然後在水中加鹽。：）您需要在家里安裝第二個獨立的管道系統，並設有鹽水抽水站和處理廠。鹽水很難迅速維護昂貴的昂貴。
Why is the Universal Basic Income in Switzerland a bad thing ?,"Switzerland is one of the wealthiest nations per capita on Earth. It achieved this feat in spite of being a landlocked country with pretty but mediocre land by offering an extremely business-friendly environment with low taxes. Thanks to this, even the poor of Switzerland are better off than the poor of most other countries. The money for basic income must come from somewhere. To obtain it, you must raise taxes. The only place this tax money can come from is from the wealthy as taxing the poor would defeat the purpose. The wealthy are highly mobile. Lower tax jurisdictions like Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Monaco are all close by. If the wealthy leave, their current taxes leave with them. Additionally, businesses will choose to expand in other nations, and move operations as Switzerland is already a terribly expensive place to be. Finally, this redistribution takes money from those who invest in growing an economy, and gives it to those who will primarily consume. It would reduce future economic growth that benefits everyone through jobs and class mobility. As the wealthy and businesses flee, the country becomes poorer, unemployment rises, and basic income becomes unsustainableIt is the ultimate eventuality so we better start to prepare for it now. We are all progressing technologically and sooner or later all the lower end jobs will start to vanish with increasing automation. The biggest market of employment of min wage is fast food. That market will eventually goto automation maybe in a decade or so. That alone will create massive unemployment. Basic income will allow people with no skills to either learn new skills and move to higher up jobs without worrying about going homeless and ending up on street. Basic income is where we are heading whether we like it or not. There simply cannot be enough jobs for everyone. Without basic income and no jobs is a recipe for violence and upheaval.",為什麼瑞士的普遍基本收入是壞事？,瑞士是地球上人均最富有的國家之一。儘管提供了一個非常適合業務友好的環境，但稅收低下，但它還是以美麗而平庸的土地而成為內陸國家，但它實現了這一壯舉。因此，即使瑞士的窮人也比其他大多數國家的窮人都更好。基本收入的錢必須來自某個地方。要獲得它，您必須提高稅收。這筆稅款可以來自的唯一位置來自富人，因為徵稅窮人會破壞目的。富人流動。Liechtenstein，Liechtenstein，Lusembourg和Monaco等較低的稅收管轄區都在附近。如果有富裕的休假，他們目前的稅款就會隨身攜帶。此外，企業將選擇在其他國家進行擴展，並隨著瑞士已經是一個非常昂貴的地方而移動業務。最後，這種重新分配從那些投資於發展經濟的人那裡獲得了錢，並將其提供給那些將主要消費的人。它將減少未來的經濟增長，通過就業和階級流動性使每個人受益。隨著富人和企業的逃離，該國變得越來越貧窮，失業率上升，基本收入變得不可持續是最終的最終事件，因此我們現在最好開始為此做準備。我們都在技術上和遲早都在進步，所有下端工作都會隨著自動化的增加而消失。最大的最小工資市場市場是快餐。這個市場最終將在十年左右的時間內獲得自動化。僅此一項就會造成大量的失業。基本收入將使沒有技能的人可以學習新技能，並搬到更高的工作，而不必擔心無家可歸併最終登上街頭。無論我們是否喜歡，基本收入都是我們前進的地方。根本不能為每個人提供足夠的工作。沒有基本收入，沒有任何工作就是暴力和動蕩的秘訣。
How did we get metal to think? How does it know what the 1's and 0's are? Is it at it's core mechanical?,"You might be referring to [this quote] about computers ""thinking"". [Here is a really good video] where people build a computer out of domino pieces. You can clearly see that those dominoes perform calculation, but they do not ""think"", it just happens because of the way they are arranged. Metal does not think either. A computer does not think. A transistor puts out electricity depending if you give it electricity or not. After all, it does not know what is 1 or 0. It is all just a bunch of transistors that electricity goes through, which in turn do calculations.

Why is soda a soothing chaser for alcohol?,"The carbonation helps to disperse remaining alcohol from the palate and tongue. Plus, it has a sugary taste.Alcohol is hard like a brick. So it's like you lick a brick and want to get that taste out of your mouth. So you want something soft like a sponge or soda to wash that taste from your mouth.Soda has a lot of sugar in it, which helps to ""sweeten"" the taste of whatever you are drinking. This counteracts the harshness of the alcohol you are drinking. Also, the carbonation helps to disperse the alcohol from your throat, which makes the drink more palatable.",為什麼蘇打水是舒緩的飲酒追逐者？,碳化有助於將剩餘的酒精從味覺和舌頭中分散。另外，它具有含糖的味道。酒精含量很難像磚頭。因此，就像您舔一塊磚頭，想從嘴裡取出這種味道。因此，您希望像海綿或蘇打水這樣柔軟的東西從您的嘴裡洗淨。Soda中有很多醣，這有助於“甜蜜”您所喝的東西的味道。這抵消了您喝酒的苛刻性。另外，碳酸化有助於從您的喉嚨中分散酒精，從而使飲料更可口。
Why does America have such a weird voting system?,"By comparison, Americans would think it weird that in parliamentary systems, you literally have no say in who becomes the head of your government. Our system is a first-past-the-post system, in which case there is mathematically no reason not to have just two big-tent parties that cover a wide amount of the electorate. It doesn't matter if you win or lose by 1% or by 20%, a loss is a loss is a loss, and a win is a win is a win. Many have issue with the FPTP system, and want it changed, but doing so is probably going to require a Constitutional Amendment, which would be rather hard to pass. It also doesn't help that the two major third parties in the US are both rather insane, and thus are marginalized because of how crazy their party members are. Case-in-point, Jill Stein is on record stating that wifi hurts children's minds, and her party held that vaccines cause autism right up until this Spring. In addition, Gary Johnson is considered a moderate by his party and barely won their nomination, and yet he wants to return the US to a commodity-backed currency, and believes that we shouldn't fight global warming because the Sun is going to destroy the Earth in a few billion years anyway.",為什麼美國有如此奇怪的投票系統？,相比之下，美國人認為在議會制度中，您從字面上沒有發言權，這是誰成為政府負責人。我們的系統是一個備受統計的系統，在這種情況下，沒有理由不只有兩個大型政黨涵蓋廣泛的選民。無論您獲勝還是損失1％，還是擊敗20％，損失是損失是損失，勝利就是勝利。許多人對FPTP系統有問題，並希望它改變，但是這樣做可能需要進行憲法修正，這很難通過。美國的兩個主要第三方都相當瘋狂，因此由於黨員的瘋狂而被邊緣化，這也無濟於事。案件中的吉爾·斯坦（Jill Stein）記錄在記錄中，指出WiFi傷害了兒童的思想，她的政黨認為疫苗會導致自閉症直到今年春天。此外，加里·約翰遜（Gary Johnson）被他的政黨視為溫和，幾乎沒有贏得提名，但他想將美國返回以商品支持的貨幣，並認為我們不應該與全球變暖作鬥爭，因為太陽將摧毀太陽無論如何，地球在數十億年內。
How did herbivorous dinosaurs get so large while have so little protein in their diet?,"Part of what allows Herbivores to grow as large as they do is that the Digestive Systems in Herbivores are optimized for extracting every bit of protein available from the food they eat. Their digestive tracts can also make some proteins from food that lack proteins. A good example is a a cow's Digestive Tract: It has four stomachs, all for getting the most nutrient possible out of every bite. Also, plants aren't necessarily devoid of protein. Plants have Keratin, which most predators, and humans, can't digest. Herbivores however, usually can digest it. This greater diversity to what a Herbivore can eat allows them to have access to a surprising amount of protein and nutrients.The largest land mammals are still all herbivores.First of all, animals don't use proteins from their food to use as building blocks. If they did, then animal proteins would have to be the same as plant proteins, which they rarely are. Instead, they break down ingested proteins into amino acids, then use instruction from their DNA to assemble them into their own proteins. As it happens, most plants are a poor source of protein but they do contain amino acids. They also contain something more important to sustaining herbivores, *cellulose*. Most ruminants have a complex digestive system that consists of multiple 'stomachs' that are used to ferment the cellulose to extract useful nutrients from it. A *symbiotic* relationship with various bacteria that live in the animals digestive system has developed. These bacteria ferment and break down the cellulose and in the process they reproduce, multiplying greatly in number. The animal then eats the results of this fermentation, bacteria and all, which it uses to sustain its own vitality and growth. TL;DR - bacteria are the main source of protein for many herbivores.",食草動物恐龍的飲食中蛋白質這麼少？,一部分使食草動物能夠像它們一樣大的生長是，食草動物中的消化系統被優化，可從食物中提取所有可用的蛋白質。他們的消化道也可以從缺乏蛋白質的食物中產生一些蛋白質。一個很好的例子是A Cow的消化道：它有四個胃，所有胃都可以從每口咬合中獲得最營養的可能性。而且，植物不一定沒有蛋白質。植物具有角蛋白，大多數捕食者和人類都無法消化。但是，食草動物通常可以消化它。食草動物可以吃的東西的更大多樣性使他們能夠獲得令人驚訝的蛋白質和養分。最大的土地哺乳動物仍然是所有草食動物。首先，動物不要將食物中的蛋白質用作積木。如果這樣做，那麼動物蛋白必須與植物蛋白相同，而植物蛋白很少。取而代之的是，它們將攝入的蛋白質分解為氨基酸，然後使用DNA的指示將其組裝成自己的蛋白質。碰巧的是，大多數植物的蛋白質來源很差，但它們確實含有氨基酸。它們還包含一些對維持食草動物的重要性的東西， *纖維素 *。大多數反芻動物具有復雜的消化系統，該消化系統由多種“胃”組成，用於發酵纖維素以從中提取有用的營養。與生活在動物消化系統中的各種細菌的共生 *關係已經發展。這些細菌發酵並分解纖維素，在此過程中，它們繁殖，數量大大繁殖。然後，該動物吃了這種發酵，細菌和所有東西的結果，並用來維持其自身的活力和生長。TL; DR-細菌是許多草食動物的主要蛋白質來源。
"How does Square Cash instantly send money to your card, where as a deposit or check from your company can take days?","You're comparing two different cash methods. Payroll uses ACH transfers, while Square Cash uses the debit card network. Square cash works by instantly debiting the sender's bank account, just like if they used their debit card at a store. The sender instantly receives the money, as it is treated like a debit card refund. Debit card transactions have to work fast because funds need to be confirmed available at point of sale. If there's no money availble, the purchase will be declined. When your paycheck is transfered to you, it uses an ACH network, which is a large conglomerate of bank transfers using your bank account number and bank routing number. It is essentially a digital check. These transfers are done in batches, and take longer to process, usually take at least 24 hours. TL;dr: Square cash uses debit cards while payroll uses digital checks",Square Cash如何立即將錢匯入您的卡，作為您公司的存款或支票可能需要幾天的時間？,您正在比較兩種不同的現金方法。工資單使用ACH轉移，而Square現金使用借記卡網絡。Square Cash可以立即藉記發件人的銀行帳戶，就像他們在商店使用借記卡一樣。發件人立即收到這筆錢，因為它被視為藉記卡退款。借記卡交易必須快速工作，因為需要在銷售點上確認資金。如果沒有資金可用，則購買將被拒絕。當您的薪水轉移給您時，它使用ACH網絡，該網絡是使用您的銀行帳號和銀行路由號的大型銀行轉讓集團。本質上是數字檢查。這些轉移分批進行，並且需要更長的時間進行處理，通常需要至少24小時。TL; DR：Square Cash使用借記卡，而工資單則使用數字支票

what do the different temperatures on a washing machine do to my clothes?,"Hot water generally cleans better but ages the clothes faster. Unless it's stained, I wash cold/cold and hang all my good shirts, shorts, and pants to dry. Warm *should* wash fastest, since it should fill the washer faster. YMMV.

"When a court orders an individual to pay restitution in the millions of dollars, how much does that person actually pay?","The person collecting will go through a process where they seize the person's assets. There are restrictions to what they can seize, like I think they have to leave you one vehicle and after they've done that, potentially garnish wages. For the most part though, everyone involved knows you're not going to get three million out of your average joe. What's more important, though, is that there will probably be an appeal. Now, the odds aren't actually great that the apartment complex will get three million again . BUT they've already shown they have a very strong case and the judge is willing to find in their favor. So what happens? They figure out how much they CAN get from the guy, and go settle for that amount. Maybe half a million. The guy says, well shit, it'll ruin my business but at least I won't be miserable having one car and a studio apartment the rest of my life. And he takes the deal. This is great for the plaintiff because they know they're never really getting their three million, and they don't have to go through a lengthy collection process, appeal process, and wait on garnished wages. They just get a lump sum of half a million dollars.",當法院命令個人以數百萬美元的價格支付賠償時，該人實際付了多少？,收集的人將經歷他們抓住該人資產的過程。他們可以抓住的東西受到限制，就像我認為他們必須離開一輛車一樣，在他們做到這一點之後，可能會裝飾工資。但是，在大多數情況下，參與其中的每個人都知道您不會從普通喬中獲得300萬。不過，更重要的是可能會有吸引力。現在，公寓大樓再次獲得三百萬的機會實際上並不大。但是他們已經表明他們有一個非常有力的案件，法官願意對他們有利。那會發生什麼呢？他們弄清楚自己可以從那個傢伙那裡得到多少，然後滿足這一數量。也許一百萬。那傢伙說，糟糕，這會毀了我的生意，但至少我一生都在擁有一輛汽車和一間錄音室的公寓不會痛苦。他接受了交易。這對原告來說很棒，因為他們知道他們從來沒有真正獲得三百萬，而且他們不必經歷冗長的收集過程，上訴過程，並等待獲得的工資。他們只是一次付了一百萬美元。
What is the margin of error?,"in statistics, its very hard to get an exact number. Most of the calculations for certain statistics come with that factor, a margin of error. Its basically the amount of possible variance in the answer. so 20% with a margin of error of 5% means the actual answer could be from 15%-25% but its definitely somewhere in there.I'd suggest reading up on margin of error as it relates to physical measurements. It's easier to understand and a lot more cut & dry compared to the wild and woolly area of sociology. If I make a physical measurement, say measuring the length of Trump's longest hair using a ruler, I might come up with 10.4 cm However, I know that between my eyesight and the fact that the marks on the ruler are only ever millimeter, the real answer isn't actually 10.4 cm, though it might be close. So based on the ruler having 1 mm marks, I might say that while I read it as 10.4, it's probably between 10.35 and 10.45 or .5 mm up or down. I'd express this by saying 10.4 +/- 0.1 cm Now let's say I'm want to add the lengths of two of Trump's hairs. One at 10.4 +/- 0.1 cm and another at 8.6 +/- 0.1 cm. When you add measurements, you add their margins of error, so you get 19 +/- 0.2 cm for the total length of the two hairs. So basically margin of error in polls is the same concept but applied to stated preferences. ",錯誤的餘量是多少？,在統計數據中，很難獲得確切的數字。某些統計數據的大多數計算都帶有該因素，這是錯誤的餘地。它基本上是答案中可能的差異。因此，誤差幅度為5％的20％意味著實際答案可能來自15％-25％，但肯定在其中。我建議閱讀與物理測量有關的錯誤餘量。與社會學的狂野和羊毛區相比，它更容易理解，並且更加干燥。如果我進行身體測量，例如使用尺子測量特朗普最長的頭髮的長度，我可能會想出10.4厘米答案實際上不是10.4厘米，儘管它可能接近。因此，基於標記具有1毫米標記的標尺，我可能會說，當我將其讀取為10.4時，大概是10.35至10.45或10.45或.5毫米。我會說10.4 +/- 0.1厘米現在可以表達這一點，現在可以說我想添加特朗普兩頭髮的長度。一個處於10.4 +/- 0.1厘米，另一個為8.6 +/- 0.1 cm。當您添加測量值時，您會添加它們的錯誤餘量，因此，對於兩根頭髮的總長度，您可以獲得19 +/- 0.2厘米。因此，基本上，民意測驗中的錯誤範圍是相同的概念，但應用於所陳述的偏好。
how do silencers on guns work?,"The bullet is launched out of the gun by an explosion that superheats the air and produces a loud BAM sound. The gas/air that carries that sound wave doesn't have anywhere to go except out with the bullet. A silencer basically extends the barrel and helps that ""explosion air"" diffuse in other directions so that the resulting explosion from the gunshot is much quieter. Movies and games that have a ""pew pew pew"" sound with the silencer attached are doing it wrong - it really is still an explosive sound, just heavily subdued, like a brick hitting a sandbag or somethingThey’re a little louder than they are portrayed to be in movies one thing most people don’t know about suppressors, is they are really uncomfortable to use. When you shoot guns with them , the suppressor causes a lot of gasses/gunpowder to travel back through the firearms receiver and sprays right into your face every time I’ve shot guns with suppressors, after about 30 shots my eyes would be stinging, and watering , and I could barely see5 year olds love balloons. Firing a gun without a suppressor is like popping a balloon. If you were to untie the balloon and let the air out slowly, yes you might get that hilarious fart sound, but it's much quieter. The hot gas in the barrel expels through the suppressor, slowing it down as it reaches the outside air. When the bullet leaves the barrel, the hot gas escapes at a higher pressure than outside air pressure. Other ways and ages to see it are opening a can of soda quickly vs slowly. Also for adults, opening a champagne bottle by popping it open or slowly releasing the built up carbonation inside. Same concept all aroundExactly like a muffler for a car. “Loud” is heat and pressure. Creating baffles allows the hot gas to expand, when it expans it cools so by the time the round cones out of the suppressor, most of the hot angry high pressure gas is gone.",槍支的消音器如何工作？,子彈是通過爆炸來使空氣過熱並產生響亮的BAM聲音的爆炸來發射的。攜帶聲波的氣/空氣除了戴著子彈之外，沒有任何地方可以走。消音器基本上會延伸槍管，並有助於“爆炸空氣”向其他方向瀰漫，以使槍聲產生的爆炸更加安靜。帶有“置於皮尤長椅”聲音的電影和遊戲中，帶有的消音器的聲音錯誤 - 它確實是一種爆炸性的聲音，只是柔和地柔和，就像磚頭擊中沙袋或有點大得多的聲音在電影中，大多數人對抑制器不了解的一件事，他們真的不舒服。當您與它們射擊槍支時，抑制器會導致許多氣體/火藥轉移到槍支接收器中，每次我用抑制器射擊槍支時，都會向您的臉上噴射，大約30張照片，我的眼睛會刺痛，並且澆水，我幾乎看不到5歲的孩子喜歡氣球。沒有抑制器發射槍就像彈出氣球。如果您要解開氣球並慢慢散發出空氣，是的，您可能會得到那種有趣的屁聲，但它更安靜。槍管中的熱氣體通過抑製劑排出，在到達外部空氣時將其放慢速度。當子彈離開槍管時，熱氣體的壓力比外部氣壓更高。看到它的其他方式和年齡正在慢慢開放一罐蘇打水。同樣對於成年人，通過將其打開或慢慢釋放出內部碳酸化的瓶裝來打開香檳瓶。同樣的概念就像是汽車的消音器一樣。“大聲”是熱量和壓力。產生擋板可以使熱氣膨脹，當它膨脹時，因此到圓錐從抑制器中出來時，大多數熱憤怒的高壓氣體都消失了。

Why are we grossed out by the thought of our family members having sex or masturbating?,"For sexually reproducing species, incest is often problematic because closely related family members are likely to share genetic problems with you that are then exacerbated in the children of incestuous couples. For this reason, many species have some sort of control against incest, typically behavioral. In humans, that control is revulsion at the idea of having sex or even thinking about sex with people who we had close contact with growing up. If we were not disgusted by envisioning family members engaged in sexual acts we might instead be aroused. This would create an evolutionary pressure against the aroused group because their children and their children's children wouldn't be able to breed as well and the family arousal trait would be out-competed by the the family disgust trait.Reproducing with close relatives is associated with a high frequency of birth defects and other genetic issues. This led to the evolution of human sexual behavior that generally excludes attraction to close relatives. Otherwise this type of reproduction would be very common, considering how much time we spend around close relatives.",為什麼我們的家庭成員發生性行為或自慰的想法使我們感到震驚？,對於性繁殖物種，亂倫通常是有問題的，因為與您的家庭成員緊密相關的家庭成員可能會與您共享遺傳問題，然後在亂倫夫婦的子女中加劇。因此，許多物種對亂倫（通常是行為）具有某種控制。在人類中，這種控制是對發生性行為甚至與我們與成長緊密接觸的人發生性關係的想法的反感。如果我們不想讓從事性行為的家庭成員感到厭惡，我們可能會被引起。這將造成針對喚醒群體的進化壓力高頻率的先天缺陷和其他遺傳問題。這導致了人類性行為的演變，通常將吸引力排除在近親。否則，考慮到我們花了多少時間圍繞近親，這種繁殖將非常普遍。
Why do sour foods make faces move involuntarily?,"Many sour foods are poisonous, we are programmed to reject sour foods with ""disgust"", same as when you see other unhealthy things like feces and Kanye West. There was a good BBC Horizon show on Disgust years back. I found this article. _URL_0_', ""> By a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter. basically what this means is that the sour item actually causes the nerves in your face to fire making the muscles they control contract. it's like you drank liquid electricity to break off creating an electric reaction.)",為什麼酸食品使面孔不由自主地移動？,許多酸味食物有毒，我們被編程為拒絕“厭惡”的酸味食物，與您看到其他不健康的東西一樣，例如糞便和坎耶·韋斯特（Kanye West）。幾年前，BBC Horizon的表演很好。我找到了這篇文章。_url_0_'，>通過直接攝入氫離子和抑制超極化通道的結合，酸味會導致味覺細胞發射動作電位並釋放神經遞質。這基本上意味著酸味實際上會導致您的物品實際上導致您的神經中的神經面對火，使他們控制收縮的肌肉。這就像您喝液體電力以破裂產生電動反應一樣。）
Why are dreams so much more vivid if you wake up during them?,"Your brain actually tries to forget dreams. Most people have more than three per night, and forget most of them. If you wake up during a dream, your brain hasn't had time to try to forget it. Partially forgotten dreams, either by waking up before the memory has faded or by the mind failing to completely forget it, will seem much duller than a fresh dream.",如果您在夢中醒來，為什麼夢想會更加生動？,您的大腦實際上試圖忘記夢想。大多數人每晚都有三個以上，並且忘記了其中的大多數。如果您在夢中醒來，您的大腦就沒有時間嘗試忘記它。部分被遺忘的夢，無論是在記憶褪色之前醒來，還是由於頭腦逐漸完全忘記了它，似乎都比一個新的夢想得多。
Why don't people get drunk on rubbing alcohol?,"Ethyl alcohol sold as rubbing alcohol is denatured. Meaning it's mixed with poisonous and disgusting tasting substances to make it undrinkable. The additives are also selected to ensure that it's difficult to purify the alcohol with distillation.People do. However, in some locations, such as the United States, it is treated with additives to make imbibers ralph it up, spit it out, or otherwise not want to drink much of itStores will not sell you ethyl alcohol unless it has been denatured, . It is denatured by adding enough other ingredients that you would become sickened if you drank it. You can get drunk on rubbing alcohol, and go blind. Do not do it.",人們為什麼不喝酒喝酒？,乙醇作為摩擦的乙醇是變性的。這意味著它與有毒和令人作嘔的品嚐物質混合在一起，使其無法脫離。還選擇了添加劑以確保很難用蒸餾淨化酒精。但是，在某些地方（例如美國），它被添加劑處理，以使拉爾夫（Ralph）吸收，吐出它，或者不想喝太多伊斯特郡（Itstores），除非已變性，否則不會向您出售乙醇。通過添加足夠的成分，如果您喝酒，它會使您感到噁心。您可以喝酒時喝酒，然後盲目。不要做。
Why is reading so encouraged and preached to be the best thing you can do for your mind?,Your perspective is limited by the thoughts you can think with the knowlege you already have. Think of a spotlight pointed at the ground at night. The main body of light is your current t knowlege. The outside aura of light are new connections you could possibly make with your current knowlege. Books expose you to thinking in new ways and very in-depth knowlege of other people. Because of the slow rate of reading you have plenty of time to absorb lots of information. I also have heard many times that watching something on a screen bypasses parts of your brain and you more readily accept the information as true without first questioning it against your current base of knowlege. Not sure what truth is in this but it seems somewhat accurate due to personal experience.,為什麼閱讀如此鼓勵和宣講是您可以為自己的想法做的最好的事情？,您的觀點受到您已經擁有的知識的想法的限制。想想晚上指向地面的聚光燈。主體的主體是您當前的知識。外部光環是您可能與當前的知識相關的新連接。書籍使您以新的方式思考和深入了解其他人。由於閱讀速度緩慢，您有足夠的時間吸收大量信息。我還聽到很多次看著屏幕上的某些東西繞過大腦的某些部分，您更容易將這些信息視為真實，而無需先詢問它，而不是針對您當前的Knowlege基礎。不確定這是什麼真理，但由於個人經驗，這似乎有些準確。
Why Bing is so poor compared to Google search engine and showing no sign of catching up or improving,"Bing is actually excellent at certain things. But my interest in it is usually short-livedGoogle has the first to market advantage. During the 90s there were hundreds and hundreds of search engines that were receiving big giant corporate bucks. When it was found that their user base wasn't responding to advertisement models properly they all folded and Google bought out any of them with decent technology. To that end, Google is an amalgamation of all the hard work of 100 search engines rolled into one. All the widgets have been very important in their success. Their being able to incorporate _URL_0_, Wikipedia, and other sources as widgets has made them a class act . Bing is a second to market alternative. Much like Google's older competitors it doesn't actually matter how many users it has. If you search ""Mount Everest"" into Bing and Google you get identical results. I don't simply mean identical as in same pages. I mean the format is exactly the same. They both have a side widget from Wikipedia. They both have the same top ten web sites. They both have Images plasted in the middle of search terms. When you offer a service that is exactly the same, first to market always has the advantage especially when both services are free. Google+ and Facebook are essentially the same thing. Google+ in some ways offers better service than Facebook to due its mass integration with Google's network. But since Facebook was first to market it is more relevant. Services like Snapchat and Twitter have more active users than both services because those services offer something different.",與Google搜索引擎相比，Bing為什麼Bing如此差，並且沒有顯示出追趕或改進的跡象,Bing實際上在某些方面非常出色。但是我對此的興趣通常是短暫的google，它是第一個獲得市場優勢的人。在90年代，有數百個搜索引擎正在收到大型公司雄鹿。當發現他們的用戶群沒有正確響應廣告模型時，他們都折疊了，Google用不錯的技術收購了其中的任何一個。為此，Google是100個搜索引擎的所有辛勤工作的合併。所有小部件在成功中都非常重要。他們能夠將_url_0_，wikipedia和其他來源作為小部件合併，使他們成為了集體行為。Bing是市場替代方案的第二次。就像Google的年長競爭對手一樣，它實際上並不重要。如果您在bing和Google中搜索“珠穆朗瑪峰”，您將獲得相同的結果。我不僅意味著與同一頁面相同。我的意思是格式完全相同。他們倆都有一個來自維基百科的小部件。他們都有相同的十大網站。他們倆都在搜索詞的中間有圖像。當您提供完全相同的服務時，首先要市場始終具有優勢，尤其是當兩種服務都是免費的時。Google+和Facebook本質上是同一回事。Google+在某些方面提供了比Facebook更好的服務，以與Google的網絡大規模集成。但是，由於Facebook首次推銷，因此更有意義。Snapchat和Twitter等服務的用戶比兩種服務都具有更多的活躍用戶，因為這些服務提供了不同的東西。
Why does only your own saliva take out your own blood in fabric (like a tshirt)?,"Not true at all. Even if saliva can remove blood , whether or not it comes from the same source as the blood makes absolutely no difference.It's not just your own, but saliva in general has a lot of enzymes that will break down molecules in blood. So it's the enzyme action that does it.",為什麼只有自己的唾液在織物上（例如T卹）取出您的血液？,根本不是真的。即使唾液可以去除血液，無論它是否來自與血液相同的來源，這絕對沒有區別。這不僅是您自己的，而且唾液通常都有很多酶會破壞血液中的分子。因此，這是酶作用。
Exactly how is smoking weed different from eating edibles. Not in your mind but chemically.,"When you eat it it gets processed by your liver into 11-hydroxy-THC. Which is said to be 5 times more psychoactive than when you smoke or vaporize cannabis.The active ingredients in smoke get absorbed directly into your bloodstream inside your lungs. The active ingredients in edibles have to be digested before they can have an effect. Not everything digests at the same speed or as efficiently, but what you breathe is all absorbed at the same time. So the effect of smoke is faster and you get all the different compounds at once, whereas with edibles it's slower and different psychoactive compounds hit your brain at different times.",確切的吸煙與食用食物有何不同。不是在您的腦海中，而是化學上。,當您食用時，肝臟會加工成11-羥基THC。據說這是吸煙或蒸發大麻的精神活性的5倍。煙霧中的活性成分直接吸收到肺部的血液中。在產生效果之前，必須消化食用中的活性成分。並非所有內容都以相同的速度或有效地消化，但是您的呼吸都同時被吸收。因此，煙霧的效果更快，您可以立即獲得所有不同的化合物，而食用物的效果較慢，不同的精神活性化合物在不同的時間擊中了您的大腦。
Is Irish a race or a nationality?,"That's ridiculous. Irish is a nationality.

It has nothing to do with race.",愛爾蘭是種族還是國籍？,這是荒謬的。愛爾蘭是一個國籍。他們可能會說，這些孩子不是愛爾蘭人，因為他們沒有正確的口音，它不遵循傳統，它發生在所有封閉的社區中，但是他們和道伊薩赫一樣愛爾蘭人。它與種族無關。
Why don't highways have designated cruise control sections/lanes?,People still have to enter and exit this section unless they are to stay in it eternally. Traffic speeds and slows from congestion purely from people making adjustments to change lanes. Consider that the range of speeds people travel down a highway doesn't vary that much normally. The thing affecting them is this merging.,為什麼高速公路沒有指定的巡航控制區/車道？,除非他們永遠留在其中，否則人們仍然必須進入和退出本節。交通速度和從擁擠中減慢，純粹是從進行調整以換車道的。考慮到人們沿著高速公路行駛的速度範圍並沒有太大變化。影響他們的事情是合併。
Where do the newborn babies in television come from?,"Most babies you see on TV are actually a lot older than you think. Most are at least a few months old.Casting agencies. Note, that those newborn babies you see on TV generally aren't newborn babies, unless you are watching a show that is putting a lot of focus on a premature baby in which case they often use dolls. Most 'newborns' on TV are actually a few months old already. There are a few shows that use actual newborn babies. Call The Midwife is one. They constantly have to find new babies to use though, because they can only film them for three days before they are 'too old'.As stated before, casting agencies provide babies that are a bit older, but they specifically look for twins and triplets. Filming reculations are VERY restrictive on how long infants can ""work"" - in California, babies up to 6 months old can be on set for two hours with just 20 minutes of filming - so it's helpful to have a couple identical babies on hand to switch places so more footage can be shot per day. As for looking truly ""newborn,"" the babies are covered in a mixture of cream cheese and jelly to simulate amniotic fluid.",電視中的新生嬰兒從何而來？,您在電視上看到的大多數嬰兒實際上比您想像的要大得多。大多數至少幾個月大。請注意，您在電視上看到的那些新生嬰兒通常不是剛出生的嬰兒，除非您正在觀看一場表演，否則將重點放在早產嬰兒上，在這種情況下，他們經常使用洋娃娃。電視上的大多數“新生兒”實際上已經已經有幾個月了。有幾場演出使用了實際的新生嬰兒。打電話是助產士。他們經常不得不找到新的嬰兒要使用，因為他們只能在“太大”之前拍攝三天。。拍攝錄音非常限制嬰兒可以“工作”多長時間 - 在加利福尼亞，只有20分鐘的拍攝時間可以待兩個小時，因此，有20分鐘的拍攝 - 因此，有幾個相同的嬰兒可以切換，這是有幫助的。地方可以每天拍攝更多鏡頭。至於看起來真正的“新生兒”，嬰兒被奶油奶酪和果凍的混合物覆蓋，以模擬羊水。
What exactly is a leasehold and freehold in UK property? How is it possible for you to buy the leasehold but not the freehold on a house?,"It would be unusual to buy a leasehold house. Leasehold properties are usually flats. The freeholder owns the building, and the land on which the building is built. You own a lease on a particular property within that building. Basically, this means you rent your property on a 125 year or 1000 year contract, except that unlike a normal rental property, you actually own this lease and have the right to sell it to someone else. Normally when you own a leasehold property you have to pay a maintenance fee to a management company. This covers the cost of maintaining the building, paying the gardener, keeping the lift running, paying for the upkeep of the private gym and the cost of the concierge Additionally, you have to pay ground-rent. This is literally just a rental fee. Some places charge a small annual fee, maybe £100 or so. Others charge what is known as a ""peppercorn fee"" - a nominal amount which would, once upon a time, have literally been a peppercorn, but now it's more likely to be £1. In contrast, if you own a freehold, then you own the land outright. You don't pay anyone anything unless you choose to, but of course you will need to pay to maintain your property unless you want it to fall apartBuying a leasehold is buying the right to use the land for a set period of time. Often this is a hundred years or more. Obviously the length of the freehold will affect the price you pay. In addition you will be required to pay ground rent, this is often a very small amount each year. If you buy a leasehold you are buying the right to use the land. With freehold you buy the land outright. It is yours forever.",英國財產中的租賃和永久業權到底是什麼？您如何購買租賃權，而不能購買房屋的永久業權？,購買租賃房屋是不尋常的。租賃財產通常是公寓。自由持有人擁有建築物以及建築物所在的土地。您擁有該建築物內特定財產的租約。基本上，這意味著您在125年或1000年的合同中租用財產，除了與普通租賃物業不同，您實際上擁有此租賃，並有權將其出售給其他人。通常，當您擁有租賃財產時，您必須向管理公司支付維護費。這涵蓋了維護建築物，支付園丁，保持升降機的費用，支付私人體育館的保養費用以及禮賓服務的費用，您還必須支付以租金支付。這實際上只是租金。有些地方收取少量年費，也許是100英鎊左右。其他人則收取所謂的“胡椒費”，這是一個名義上的金額，從前，它實際上是胡椒粉，但現在更有可能是1英鎊。相反，如果您擁有永久業權，那麼您將直接擁有土地。除非您選擇，否則您什麼都不會付任何東西，但是當然，除非您希望租賃的租賃權正在購買固定的一段時間內使用土地的權利，否則您當然需要付費才能維護財產。通常這是一百年或更長時間。顯然，永久業權的長度會影響您支付的價格。此外，您將被要求支付地租金，這通常每年很少。如果您購買租賃權，則您將購買使用土地的權利。有了永久業權，您可以直接購買土地。永遠是你的。
How do colorblindness correction glasses work?,"The website for the company that makes them has a pretty good explanation. Basically what happens is you have four types of light sensors in your eye: red, green, and blue cones plus rods. Their affinity to register light of different frequencies is shown [here], which basically means that a photon at 420 nm is very likely to set off a blue cone and less likely to set off a rod, while a photon at 500 nm will likely set off a rod but almost certainly won't set off a blue cone. When the different colors of cones fire you see different colors, and when the rods fire you see white. When you see yellow it's because both your red and green cones are firing at the same time--every different color you can perceive corresponds to a different ratio of different types of cones firing. The rods are mostly used in dim light, so bright white light is caused by all the types of cones firing about the same amount. Now, colorblindness. The issue with red-green colorblindness is that instead of having different frequency responses, the red and green cones have about the same frequency response in colorblind people. That means that any light causes them to fire the same amount, which makes red and green both look yellow. The glasses take advantage of the fact that the frequency responses still aren't exactly the same--they just overlap much more than they're supposed to. The glasses use nonlinear effects to make light with wavelengths shorter than 550 nm have even shorter wavelengths, and light with wavelengths longer than 550 nm have even longer wavelengths. That means light that should normally stimulate the green but not red cones, when passed through the glasses is shifted far enough towards blue that it really does stimulate the green cones more than the red .",色盲校正眼鏡如何工作？,該公司的網站使他們有一個很好的解釋。基本上發生的是，您的眼睛中有四種輕型傳感器：紅色，綠色和藍色錐和桿。顯示了它們對不同頻率的登記光的親和力[此處]，這基本上意味著420 nm處的光子很可能會啟動藍色錐體，而較小的桿子卻不太可能啟動桿，而在500 nm處的光子很可能會設置從桿上脫下，但幾乎肯定不會伸出藍色的錐體。當錐體的不同顏色發射時，您會看到不同的顏色，當桿射擊時，您會看到白色。當您看到黃色時，這是因為您的紅色和綠色錐都同時發射 - 您可以感知到的每種不同的顏色都對應於不同類型的圓錐射擊的不同比例。桿主要用於昏暗的光線，因此明亮的白光是由大約相同量的所有錐體發射類型引起的。現在，色盲。紅綠色色盲的問題在於，紅色和綠色的錐體沒有不同的頻率響應，而是在色盲人群中具有相同的頻率響應。這意味著任何光都會導致它們發射相同的量，這會使紅色和綠色看起來都黃色。眼鏡利用了頻率響應並不完全相同的事實 - 它們的重疊比預期的要多得多。眼鏡使用非線性效應使波長短於550 nm的波長甚至更短的波長，並且波長超過550 nm的光具有更長的波長。這意味著通常應該刺激綠色但不要刺激紅色錐體的光，當穿過眼鏡時，它朝藍色移動得足夠遠，以至於它確實比紅色更刺激綠色錐體。
"if cameras take square photos, why are the apertures round?","You've sort of got it the wrong way round. The camera LENSES are round, because round lenses bend light much better. But the film the image is captured on is rectangular, for the same reason that all pictures are usually rectangles, easier to frame and they are easier to put onto walls. Modern camera sensors have just continued this. Also when light is bent by a round lens, the images around the edges are often distorted, by using rectangle sensors you are just cropping these out and getting a better image.There is a square area at the back of the camera that opens and exposes the film when the shitter is released, with digital the mirror lifts up when you press the shutter, and a square digital photo sensor is exposed. The aperture only lets in light and the image, what goes on the film/sensor is the final square insane', ""Lenses are round, because round glass elements transmit light the best and provide the clearest image out the other end. apertures are round because round apertures work well in round lenses, and also provide pleasant looking results in photos. A [square aperture would cause square shaped blurry objects in out of focus areas in the shot] which is distracting and somewhat unpleasant. A round lens puts out a cone-shaped beam of light that resolves the image into a circle behind the lens, and then the sensor/film that captures the light is rectangular shaped, and sits in the center of that image circle. Images are shaped the way they are because of roll film, generally. A circular piece of film/sensor would technically capture more area out of the total projected image circle, but it's hard to make a roll of circles that tie together the way that a roll of rectangular frames of film does. They're also a lot harder to print and display. The outside edges of the projected image circle also suffer from vignetting and issues with diffraction and fine detail, and generally the crop provided by the rectangular film/sensor inside of that image circle crops out the best portion of the image, and leaves the dark/blurry/aberrant portion of the image.",如果攝像機拍攝正方形照片，為什麼孔徑是圓形的？,您的回合是錯誤的。相機鏡頭是圓形的，因為圓形鏡片彎曲的光得多。但是，捕獲圖像的膠片是矩形，其原因是所有圖片通常都是矩形，易於框架，並且更容易放在牆上。現代相機傳感器剛剛繼續。同樣，當圓形鏡頭彎曲時，邊緣周圍的圖像通常會扭曲，使用矩形傳感器，您只是在裁剪這些圖像並獲得更好的圖像。當您按下快門時，射擊器發行時，鏡子會抬起，並暴露了一個方形的數字照片傳感器。孔只允許光線和圖像，膠片/傳感器上的內容是最終的正方形，”鏡頭是圓形的，因為圓形玻璃元素會發出最好的光線，並提供最清晰的圖像。因為圓形光圈在圓形鏡頭上很好地工作，並且還可以在照片中提供宜人的外觀結果。錐形光束將圖像解散成鏡頭後面的一個圓，然後捕獲光的傳感器/膜是矩形形狀的，位於該圖像圓的中心。圖像是形狀的，因為它們的形狀。通常，膠卷膠片。從技術上講，圓形的膠片/傳感器將捕獲更多的投影圖像圓圈，但是很難將一卷圓圈捲起來，以將膠卷膠卷的方式綁在一起。它們也很難打印和顯示。投影圖像圓的外部邊緣還遭受了衍射和細節的漸暈和問題，通常是該圖像圓內部的矩形膜/傳感器提供的作物，將圖像的最佳部分散發出來，並留下黑暗的/圖像的模糊/異常部分。

"Why do they say to ""breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth"" when exercising?","When you breathe in through your nose you're filtering the air before it goes into your lungs, and pulling it through a smaller opening, forcing you to inhale slower taking deeper breaths. You exhale through your mouth because it's a bigger opening and you want to get the 'bad air' out as fast as you can. Your nose also helps regulate the temperature of the air you're breathing. When it goes in your mouth it goes very quickly into your lungs, and if it's too cold it can be jarring to your lungs. I'd guess, when it's way too hot out, like today, it also serves to cool it down a bit.",鍛煉時，為什麼他們說“通過鼻子呼吸”？,當您通過鼻子呼吸時，您會在空氣進入肺部之前過濾空氣，然後將其拉動較小的開口，迫使您喘不過氣。您可以通過嘴呼氣，因為它是一個更大的開口，您想盡可能快地將“不良空氣”取出。您的鼻子還有助於調節您呼吸的空氣溫度。當它進入您的嘴裡時，它很快就會進入您的肺部，如果太冷，它可能會刺入您的肺部。我想，當它太熱時，就像今天一樣，它也可以使其冷卻一點。

What is blood type? Why is our blood different?,"Not quite 5, but I'll give it a shot. Blood type refers to the type of cell marker that exists on the outside of your red blood cells. There are 3 types- A, B, and O. If you have A, B is considered foreign so you will have anti-B antibodies. The same can be said for A if you have B type blood. If you have O, it is neither A nor B so you make antibodies for both A and B. AB blood types have no antibodies since both types are present on their cells. Type ABs are referred to as ""universal recipients"" because they have no antibodies in their blood and can therefore receive any type of blood without fear of the body rejecting it. Type Os are the universal donors under most condition but this can vary depending on other more complicated factors since as I mentioned before they have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. These types are genetic. A and B are dominant to O, and if you get an A from one parent and a B from another, you will be AB .It's kinda like [this], except when the right block goes through the right shaped hole, it gets stuck and you can't remove it from the box. Your own bloodtype has blocks that don't match your box, so they can't get stuck inside. Other bloodtypes, however, have blocks on their surface that WILL match your box, and WILL get stuck inside. Type AB bloodtype has no boxes, and so can take blood from anyone. Type O has no blocks, so it isn't as much of a problem for them to donate blood to anyone else. Their box does match all blocks, but this doesn't detriment health too much, because generally, there are much more blocks present than there are boxes.",什麼是血型？為什麼我們的血液與眾不同？,還不到5，但我會試一試。血型是指在紅細胞外部存在的細胞標記類型。有3種類型的A，B和O。如果您有A，B被認為是外國的，那麼您將具有抗B抗體。如果您有B型血液，也可以這樣說。如果您有O，則既不是A也不是B，因此您對A和B的B型抗體都沒有抗體，因為兩種類型都存在於其細胞上。腹肌類型被稱為“普遍接受者”，因為他們的血液中沒有抗體，因此可以接受任何類型的血液，而不必擔心身體會拒絕它。OS類型是在大多數條件下的通用供體，但這可能會因其他更為複雜的因素而異，因為正如我提到的那樣，它們具有抗A和抗B抗體。這些類型是遺傳的。a和b是o的主導地位，如果您從一個父母那裡獲得A，而另一個父母則是AB。而且您無法將其從框中刪除。您自己的血液塊的塊與您的盒子不匹配，因此它們不會被卡在裡面。但是，其他血型的表面上有塊，可以與您的盒子相匹配，並且會粘在裡面。類型AB BloodType沒有盒子，因此可以從任何人那裡獲得血液。O類型沒有障礙，因此向其他人捐獻血液並不是什麼問題。他們的盒子確實與所有塊相匹配，但這並不損害健康，因為通常，存在的塊比有盒子要多得多。
"why do body parts hurt long after an injury is healed, especially when the weather changes?","Well, I don't know about bone fractures. Most of the Pain - > Weather predictions I've seen have been about joint pain. The most common explanation is that damaged joints respond to changes in atmospheric pressure. Rain, and especially large storms, are accompanied by a drop in pressure. That pressure drop causes damaged tissue to swell up. The swelling tissue causes the joint to ache and alerts the person to the impending weather change.",為什麼身體部位在受傷後很長時間受傷，尤其是天氣變化時？,好吧，我不知道骨折。我看到的大多數疼痛 - >天氣預測是關於關節痛的。最常見的解釋是，受損的關節對大氣壓力的變化做出了反應。雨，尤其是大風暴，伴隨著壓力下降。壓力下降會導致組織受損的組織腫脹。腫脹的組織會導致關節疼痛，並提醒人們即將來臨的天氣變化。
Why is my graphics card so big compared to my CPU?,"Your graphics card has it's own RAM. Your CPU's RAM is on the motherboard. Technically you're counting the GPU, it's board, and RAM, and cooling stuff as one thing. So if you do that with the CPU too, the CPU is much bigger since its board is the motherboard.",為什麼我的圖形卡與我的CPU相比這麼大？,您的圖形卡具有自己的RAM。您的CPU的公羊在主板上。從技術上講，您正在計算GPU，板和RAM，並將其冷卻作為一回事。因此，如果您也使用CPU執行此操作，則CPU更大，因為其板是主板。
Why are terraced houses in New York and possibly other places elevated?,"They have lower levels besides the main entrance, they usually go below street level. Every place is different, but I would assume that the underground pipping as well as water level do not allow for basements of considerable depth, which is why he main level is above street level. These lower levels have their own exterior door and are rented outFor some of the buildings they were built before modern sewer and road systems so the lower part is where the street level was when the building was built. As they laid down sewer piping or other systems and paved roads they built the road up instead of digging out the existing road. For some the building were build with servants entrances being on lower levels and people of importance entering at the second floor. For some buildings they were not able to get full basements built and so they have what is known as a half basement.",為什麼紐約的梯田房屋以及可能升高的其他地方？,除了正門外，它們的水平較低，通常也位於街道上。每個地方都不同，但是我認為地下坡道以及水位不允許地下室深度相當大，這就是為什麼他的主要水平高於街道的原因。這些較低的層有自己的外門，並在現代下水道和道路系統之前建造的一些建築物出租，因此下部是街道建築物建造時的位置。當他們放下下水道管道或其他系統和鋪裝道路時，他們建造了這條路，而不是挖出現有道路。對於某些建築物而言，建築物是僕人的入口處於較低水平，並且在二樓很重要的人。對於某些建築物，他們無法建造完整的地下室，因此它們具有所謂的半地下室。
Why does daycare cost so much when the teachers are paid so poorly?,"It's for much the same reason that private schools are very expensive: teachers' salaries are only a small portion of the costs of operating the business. Add to this these costs: * Supplies* Rent for the facilities* Administrative costs * Taxes* FICA/Medicare for employees* Training for the teachers* Liability insurance* Legal counsel* Employee benefits * etc.Thats a great question! I am a teacher and my pay sucks. Daycare can be upwards of $8000 a year. Hm .perhaps its a racketBecause other costs such as rent, electric, liability insurance, and the fact that there is a restriction of no more than 3 children per teacher, mean that there are limited economies of scale.",當老師的薪水如此差時，為什麼日託的費用如此之多？,出於與眾不同的原因，私立學校非常昂貴：教師的薪水只是經營業務成本的一小部分。再加上這些費用：*供應*設施的租金*行政費用*稅款* fica/fica for fiCA fica/for for僱員*為教師培訓*責任保險*法律顧問*法律顧問*員工福利*等。這是一個很好的問題！我是老師，我的薪水很糟糕。日托每年可以高達8000美元。HM。也許是其他費用，因為租金，電動，責任保險以及每個老師的限制不超過3個孩子，這意味著規模經濟經濟有限。
Why do we feel hot when the air is as hot as or colder than our internal body temperature?,"Because our bodies don't just sit at our preferred temperature. Humans are warm-blooded; we produce heat constantly as a byproduct of the chemical reactions in our body that maintain our metabolism. That means that we have to constantly get rid of heat at the rate that our body produces it just to stay at the same temperature. Otherwise, we'll overheat and possibly die. When the air is near our internal temperature, the rate at which we lose heat to the environment slows down. When the air reaches our internal temperature, we can no longer lose heat the normal way, and we have to sweat, which allows us to lose heat via evaporative cooling.",當空氣比我們的內部溫度更熱或更冷時，為什麼我們會感到熱？,因為我們的身體不僅坐在我們的首選溫度下。人類是溫暖的；我們不斷產生熱量作為維持新陳代謝的化學反應的副產品。這意味著我們必須不斷以身體產生的速度來消除熱量，只是為了保持相同的溫度。否則，我們將過熱並可能死亡。當空氣接近我們的內部溫度時，我們失去熱量的速度會減慢。當空氣達到內部溫度時，我們將不再以正常的方式失去熱量，我們必須出汗，這使我們能夠通過蒸發冷卻而失去熱量。
What is the weight of gravity in pounds and how to find it?,"Gravity is a force, while weight is the effect of gravity on a given mass. You cannot convert gravity in to weight. It's like asking me to tell you the speed of your car using only the measurement of how much gas you have in the tank.",磅重的重力是多少？如何找到它？,重力是一種力，而重量是重力對給定質量的影響。您不能將重力轉化為重量。這就像要求我只使用儲罐中有多少汽油的測量來告訴您汽車的速度。
"Why can't ""We the People"" petition to have the NSA shut down (and it actually work..)?","That would be a [direct democracy].

Why can some humans survive thousands of feet while others die after a short fall?,"It all has to do with mechanics and overall health. If you're reasonably healthy, well built, and happen to land the ""right"" way so that your body can absorb the shock of the landing, you may be bruised or even break something but you should be ok. Meanwhile, a leading cause of death in old people is falls. Older people have far more brittle bones and the like and it's much easier for them to fracture something and lead to even more internal damage. There's also the mechanics of the fall. If you fall in a way that you can use the momentum to ""correct"" the fall , you should be alright. But if you fall maybe a short distance and land on your head with nothing absorbing the fall or getting rid of the kinetic energy that really damages you, you're going to be injured or die. Bear in mind that falls are basically vertical collisions. Some people can survive being hit head on by a truck while others die immediately in some other wrecks.They don't. If you survive a crazy fall like that it's because you got insanely lucky with tree branches or something. Humans can't survive a fall like that, it's physics.",為什麼有些人可以生存數千英尺，而另一些人在短暫跌倒後死亡？,這都與力學和整體健康有關。如果您是合理的健康，建立良好的，並且碰巧以“正確”的方式降落，以便您的身體能夠吸收著陸點的震動，那麼您可能會受傷甚至破壞東西，但您應該沒事。同時，老年人死亡的主要原因是跌倒。老年人的骨頭等脆弱得多，對他們來說，骨折並導致更大的內部傷害要容易得多。還有秋天的機制。如果您以一種可以使用勢頭“糾正”秋天的動力的方式，那麼您應該沒事。但是，如果您可能跌落很短的距離，並且沒有吸收跌倒或擺脫真正損害您的動能，那麼您將受傷或死亡。請記住，跌倒基本上是垂直碰撞。有些人可以倖免於被卡車撞到，而另一些人則立即死於其他殘骸。他們沒有。如果您能像那樣的瘋狂秋天生存，那是因為您對樹枝之類的東西非常幸運。人類無法像這樣生存，這是物理學。
Why don't we sue politicians for broken election promises as breach of verbal contract?,"There is a saying that a verbal contract isn't worth the paper its printed on. But beyond that humorous quote, there is a better reason. An elected official can simply say that the situation or information changed in the time between the campaign and the vote, which is a great defense, because that's how we want our representatives to act.",為什麼我們不起訴政客因違反口頭合同而違反的選舉承諾？,有一種說法，口頭合同不值得印刷的紙張。但是除了那個幽默的報價之外，還有更好的理由。當選官員可以簡單地說，競選活動和投票之間的時間或信息發生了變化，這是一個很好的辯護，因為這就是我們希望代表採取行動的方式。
"Why can't they make a cheap car that is made of basic parts internally, but looks high end externally?","The look of a Lamborghini does cost lots of money to make. Lots of weird shapes in the metal and plastic. Expensive materials, etc. It's not just the engine that is pricey. What you're describing is basically a kit car, which are available and hobbyists put them together to be exactly this. People who like sports cars don't just like how they look, but how they handle and accelerate and lots of other things. Your average person might want a Lambo in their garage but probably don't want to get stared at or ooed and ahhd at driving it around town, and would probably be terrified of parking it in a public place. Most people don't like nearly lying down in their driver's seat like you do in a lambo. They like to have a place to put a bag of groceries, or a couple other people or kids. That said, there are plenty of cheap sporty looking cars out there.Companies don't do this, because that would devalue the ""good cars"". If your shitty car can look like a high end car. Why buy a high end cars.",他們為什麼不能在內部製造由基本零件製成的廉價汽車，但外部看起來很高？,蘭博基尼的外觀確實花了很多錢。金屬和塑料中的許多怪異形狀。昂貴的材料等。不僅是發動機昂貴。您所描述的基本上是一輛套件，它可用，業餘愛好者將它們融合在一起。喜歡跑車的人不僅喜歡它們的外觀，而且還喜歡他們的處理和加速以及許多其他事情。您的普通人可能想要在自己的車庫裡放一輛蘭博，但可能不想盯著或被拒絕，而Ahhd則在鎮上開車，並且可能會害怕將其停在公共場所。大多數人不喜歡像在蘭博那樣躺在駕駛員座位上。他們喜歡一個地方放一袋雜貨，或其他幾個人或孩子。也就是說，那裡有很多便宜的運動型汽車。如果您骯髒的汽車看起來像高端汽車。為什麼要購買高端汽車。
"EL 5, How is it that ""polar bear"" clubs can go swimming in January and not die of hypothermia?","They basically just go in and out of the water, and they're prepared with towels and warm clothes as soon as they're done. Even in near-freezing water, it takes at least 10-15 minutes for hypothermia to happen. Also, at least in the bigger polar bear clubs, there's medical staff around in case of emergencies.Further, the problem with cold water normally is the shock of falling in as opposed to the actual cold. Hence the importance of preparation.",El 5，“北極熊”俱樂部如何在一月份游泳而不死於體溫過低？,他們基本上只是進出水，然後就準備好一完成的毛巾和溫暖的衣服。即使在幾乎凍結的水中，體溫過低至少需要10-15分鐘。另外，至少在較大的北極熊俱樂部中，在緊急情況下周圍有醫務人員。庫，冷水的問題通常是跌倒而不是實際感冒的震驚。因此，準備的重要性。
Til Death do us Part. Do religious people believe they are all single in Heaven?,"This is coming from a Christian perspective, but marriage is seen as an earthly example of our relationship with Christ, we find fulfillment in caring and loving on our spouse and we get the benefit of them doing the same for us. Now once we get to heaven we are completely and entirely fulfilled by God for He is our ultimate desire of the relationship we were seeking on earth. Now we still get to chill with our loved ones but it marriage is no longer needed like it was, sorry if that was too preachy, hope that makes senseChristians do. When people asked Jesus who a widow that had remarried would be with in heaven Jesus answered that there was no marriage in heaven. So the line in the traditional Christian Marriage vows of ""till death do us part"" reflects that beliefMormons don't. Marriages performed in temples are called sealings. The last line of the ceremony is ""for time and all eternity"" and not ""til death"". You can also be sealed to your children, so family units remain intact. There will still be single people of course, including those not sealed during mortality, but they believe even after death those who didn't have a chance to do it will receive the opportunity via proxy ordinancesDo all religious people think the same things?",直到死亡讓我們分開。宗教人士認為他們在天堂都是單身嗎？,這是從基督教的角度出現的，但是婚姻被視為我們與基督關係的塵世典範，我們發現對我們的配偶關懷和愛心的滿足感，我們從他們為我們做同樣的事情中受益。現在，一旦我們到達天堂，我們就完全並完全由上帝實現，因為他是我們對我們在地球上尋求的關係的最終渴望。現在，我們仍然可以和我們的親人放鬆，但不再需要像這樣的婚姻，對不起，如果那太講道了，希望這能使感覺教學家能夠做到。當人們問耶穌是誰結婚的遺ow時，耶穌回答說天堂沒有婚姻。因此，傳統的基督教婚姻的界線誓言“直到死亡我們的一部分”反映了信仰態度所沒有的。在寺廟中進行的婚姻稱為密封。儀式的最後一行是“時間和所有永恆”，而不是“直到死亡”。您也可以將其密封給您的孩子，因此家庭單位保持完整。當然，仍然會有一個人，包括在死亡過程中未被密封的人，但是他們相信即使死後，那些沒有機會這樣做的人也會通過代理委員會獲得機會，因為多宗教徒都認為所有宗教人士都認為同樣的事情嗎？
Vulgar Latin and it's difference between Classical Latin,"Vulgar Latin uses more vocabulary that made it into modern Romance languages, and the sentence structure is often more like the modern Romance languages too. So stuff like: occasionally, you'll see the relative pronoun used to mark indirect discourse instead of accusative + infinitive constructions. The pronunciation is also different, but that probably won't matter in your class. Most people I've spoken to have said they found Mediaeval Latin 'easier' than Classical Latin. And the subject matter is often more church-focused, so you'll run into lots of new ecclesiastical vocabulary often borrowed from Greek ), or new meanings for old words ",庸俗的拉丁語及其在古典拉丁語之間的區別,庸俗的拉丁語使用更多的詞彙，使其成為現代浪漫語言，而句子結構通常也更像現代浪漫語言。因此，諸如：有時，您會看到用於標記間接話語的相對代詞，而不是指責 +不定式的構造。發音也有所不同，但這在您的班上可能無關緊要。我所說的大多數人都說他們發現中世紀拉丁語比古典拉丁語“容易”。而且主題通常更注重教會，因此您會遇到許多經常從希臘語借來的新教會詞彙），或者舊單詞的新含義
I've never seen a fat bird. Is that because flying is vital for them to survive so natural selection kills them or because birds simply don't get fat?,"People commenting here don't know what they're talking about. Birds do get fat the closer you get to the cold extremes . You've never seen one because, I assume, you haven't been to these types of places. Furthermore, you wouldn't know how fat the bird is until you kill and butcher it, but I promise, there are fat birds. Yes, flight is a big part of their survival, but so is fat in the cold weather. As with most things, there's a balance. When colder season come, birds store fat. Not enough that they cannot fly anymore, but they do store fat. When it's time to migrate, a lot of that fat gets burned off.",我從未見過一隻胖鳥。那是因為飛行對他們生存至關重要，所以自然選擇會殺死它們，或者因為鳥類根本不會脂肪殺死？,在這裡發表評論的人不知道他們在說什麼。鳥兒確實會使脂肪越接近寒冷的極端。您從未見過，因為我認為，您從未去過這些類型的地方。此外，直到殺死和屠宰它，您才知道這隻鳥有多胖，但是我保證，有胖鳥。是的，飛行是他們生存的重要組成部分，但在寒冷的天氣中脂肪也是如此。與大多數事情一樣，有一個平衡。寒冷的季節來了，鳥類儲存脂肪。不夠，他們不能再飛行了，但是它們確實儲存了脂肪。當該遷移時，很多脂肪被燃燒了。
How does paracetomol work?,"The mechanism of action for Paracetamol/acetomenophen is not entirely understood. It *probably* inhibits COX, which is an enzyme that is part of the chemical pathway for chemical pain signals in the body. Inhibit the enzyme, the body makes less pain-signalling chemicalsWhen you have a fever or other inflammation going on there is an abundance of prostanoids being produced at the site of inflammation. This group of chemicals is responsible for inflammation and vasoconstriction among other things. Now your brain typically interprets this signal as pain or soreness. Think how sore an inflamed sinus is! paracetomol, or acetominophen in the states, acts by inhibiting the enzyme that creates these protanoids. Therefore stopping the pain and inflammation response at the source.",撲熱息痛如何工作？,乙酰氨基酚/乙酰基因的作用機制尚不完全了解。它 *可能 *抑制了Cox，這是一種酶，是體內化學疼痛信號的化學途徑的一部分。抑制酶，人體使您的疼痛信號化學劑較少，您發燒或其他炎症正在發生，在炎症部位會產生大量的前列腺素。這組化學物質負責炎症和血管收縮。現在，您的大腦通常將此信號解釋為疼痛或酸痛。想想發炎的竇有多痛！在美國的乙酰莫諾或乙酰氨基酚，通過抑制產生這些原生物的酶來起作用。因此，阻止了來源的疼痛和炎症反應。
"Why is ""I don't like sand"" line from Attack of the Clones considered so bad?","It's supposed to be Anakin's smooth line to use on Padme and it's just so derpy and cringeworthy.

Do you need a computer to create a computer?,"Assuming that all humans alive today survived, there's a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience that could be used to quickly bypass lots of steps along the way. As an example of this, check out [the best Commodore 64 games] from the mid 1980's, and compare that to the winners of the [2010's Commodore 64 Demoscene] where people take all of the advances in programming from the last 30 years and apply them to old hardware. It's true that modern computers are designed and built in part by computers, so it 'd probably take several years to rebuild simple computers by hand, then use those to build more and more complex computers from there. But it 'd take far less than 70 years to ""catch up"" because we have the advantage of knowing the full history.",您需要計算機來創建計算機嗎？,假設今天所有的人類都倖存下來，那麼有大量的知識和經驗可以用來迅速繞過許多步驟。為此，請查看[1980年代中期的最佳準將64場比賽]，並將其與[2010年的Commodore 64 Demoscene的獲獎者]進行比較，人們從過去30年開始就採取了所有編程的進步併申請它們到舊硬件。的確，現代計算機是由計算機設計和構建的，因此可能需要幾年的時間才能手工重建簡單的計算機，然後使用這些計算機從那裡構建越來越複雜的計算機。但是，“趕上”需要不到70年的時間，因為我們有了解完整歷史的優勢。
What is more environmentally friendly forced air hand dryers or paper towel?,"New air dryers are more environmentally friendly than paper towels. Older dryers might not be, because they use more power.For the most part, the air dryers are better in terms of energy. They cost less to run and you don't have to keep putting towels in them. Lots of people don't like them, though, since they take longer to dry. In any case, I suggest this ted video: _URL_0_ - he talks about the different techniques used for drying your hands with paper towels .Air dryers are more environmentally friendly than paper. Paper is more hygienic - air driers spread germs everywhere.",什麼是更環保的強迫空氣烘乾機或紙巾？,新的空氣乾燥機比紙巾更環保。較舊的干衣機可能不是，因為它們使用更多的功率。在大多數情況下，空氣乾燥機在能量方面都更好。它們的運行成本較小，您不必繼續在其中戴毛巾。不過，很多人不喜歡它們，因為它們需要更長的時間才能乾燥。無論如何，我建議使用此TED視頻：_URL_0_-他談論用於用紙巾乾燥手的不同技術。空氣烘乾機比紙張更環保。紙張更衛生 - 空氣乾燥器到處傳播細菌。
why does all music attach me to something thats occuring in my life and make me feel nostalgic even a weel later?,"Because that's effectively how your brain functions. Your brain is a collection of neurons that fire in sequence. Your brain is always being adjusted, new connections are formed as you 'learn' new 'information'. Essentially, your brain is correlating an experience of life with the auditory experience of that specific music. So when the neurons for that music are activated the adjoining ones referencing that memory/experience are fired in tandem. Your brain does this for pretty much everything. I say 'game' you think 'fun'. I say 'car', you think 'travel' or 'speed'. The only difference is that it isn't language it's music. So yes I'd go as far as to say this is normal. It would depend on how often you listen, the time difference between the experience and the listening session, as well as how long you hold on to specific tracks of music.",為什麼所有音樂都將我貼在生活中發生的事情上，並在一周後使我感到懷舊？,因為這實際上是您的大腦運作方式。您的大腦是一系列神經元的收集。您的大腦總是在調整，在學習“新信息”時會形成新的聯繫。本質上，您的大腦將生活體驗與特定音樂的聽覺體驗相關聯。因此，當該音樂的神經元被激活時，毗鄰的音樂引用了記憶/體驗會串聯發射。您的大腦幾乎可以做到這一點。我說“遊戲”你認為“有趣”。我說“汽車”，您認為“旅行”或“速度”。唯一的區別是它不是語言的音樂。所以是的，我會說這是正常的。這將取決於您聆聽的頻率，體驗和聽力會議之間的時差，以及您持續多長時間來遵守音樂的特定曲目。
What is the point of having a complex password? If someone figures out your password what does the complexity change?,"It makes it harder for someone to find out your password. It's not difficult to build a computer system which tries your username, with a password that's a word from a dictionary, over and over again. Such a system can go through a whole dictionary in a couple of hours. This method of finding a password is known as a ""brute force"" attack. So using a word from a dictionary makes it easy for someone to find your password with this method. Using a long combination of letters and numbers, which don't form a single word, makes a brute force attack impossible. With a password just 10 or 12 characters long, the number of possibilities, if you don't have a dictionary to work from, is so huge that it would take a lifetime, literally, for a brute force attack to be completedThe point is that it is supposed to make it harder to figure out your password to begin with. It is a defense against brute force, dictionary, and hybrid type attacks. For example, most passwords are between 6-8 characters. If I want to guess all such passwords just using letters , that's 20 billion possibilities for 6 character passwords, 1 trillion possibilities for 7 character passwords, and 53 trillion possibilities for 8 character passwords. When you introduce complexity, such as numbers and symbols all of those ""52""s become ""72"". So 20 billion becomes 140 billion, 1 trillion becomes 10 trillion, and 53 trillion becomes 722 trillion. So you are increasing the difficulty of such attacks by a factor of 7 to 13Having a complex password makes it more difficult for anyone to figure it out by chance",擁有復雜的密碼有什麼意義？如果有人弄清楚您的密碼，複雜性會發生什麼變化？,它使某人更難找到您的密碼。構建嘗試您的用戶名的計算機系統並不難，一遍又一遍地使用字典中的單詞來嘗試您的用戶名。這樣的系統可以在幾個小時內完成整個詞典。這種查找密碼的方法稱為“蠻力”攻擊。因此，使用字典中的單詞可以輕鬆使用此方法找到您的密碼。使用長的字母和數字組合，這些字母和數字不會形成一個單詞，這使得蠻力攻擊不可能。密碼只有10或12個字符的長度，如果您沒有詞典可以使用的可能性數量，那麼從字面上看，野蠻的攻擊才能完成一生，這是一個重點是它應該使您很難弄清楚您的密碼。它是針對蠻力，詞典和混合型攻擊的防禦。例如，大多數密碼在6-8個字符之間。如果我想猜測所有此類密碼僅使用字母，那是6個字符密碼的200億可能性，7個字符密碼的1萬億個可能性以及8個字符密碼的53萬億個可能性。當您引入複雜性時（例如數字和符號）所有“ 52” s變為“ 72”。因此，有200億，1400億，1萬億人變成10萬億，而53萬億美元變為722萬億。因此，您將此類攻擊的困難增加了7至13have的一個複雜密碼，因此任何人都難以偶然地弄清楚它
Why do some downloads not show file size and / or ETAs?,"When you make an HTTP connection, there are a bunch of pieces of metadata that are sent before the data. One of those is Content-Length, which tells your client how long the data portion is going to be. If you don't see a file size in a download, it means the server didn't send a Content-Length header, so your client has no idea how much data is going to come, and it just needs to continue receiving data until the server stops sending it.",為什麼有些下載不顯示文件大小和 /或ETA？,當您建立HTTP連接時，會在數據之前發送一堆元數據。其中之一是內容長度，它告訴您的客戶端數據部分將要多長時間。如果您在下載中看不到文件大小，則意味著服務器沒有發送內容長度的標題，因此您的客戶不知道會有多少數據，只需要繼續接收數據，直到服務器停止發送它。
How do coffee machines (like a Keurig) super heat water in 10 seconds?,"a thin layer of water heats up very quickly.

"When you boil water, where does the air that fills the bubbles come from?","""Boiling"" is the process of water becoming steam. The ""air"" in those bubbles is water turning into its gaseous form from its liquid formWhen you heat water, the first bubbles that appear are the air that was dissolved in it. This is because gasses are more soluble in cold water than hot. Once the air is driven off, the bubbles are from steam, or water vapor.That's not air. It's steam. It's the water in the pot turning into a gas.The air in the bubble, or the bubble as such, is basically water in the gaseous state. When you boil water in a metal container, you would notice that the bubbles start coming from that area where maximum heating happens. The hot metal transfers so much of heat, so fast to the water touching it that, before that water transfers heat to nearby water, it gets converted to steam. This steam is what you see bubbling up to the surface.",當您開水時，充滿氣泡的空氣來自哪裡？,“沸騰”是水變為蒸汽的過程。這些氣泡中的“空氣”是從您的液體形式變成氣體形式的水，當您加熱水時，出現的第一個氣泡是溶解在其中的空氣。這是因為氣體比熱水更可溶。一旦空氣被驅逐出空氣，氣泡就會從蒸汽或水蒸氣中。這不是空氣。這是蒸汽。它是鍋中變成氣體的水。氣泡中的空氣或這樣的氣泡基本上是氣態的水。當您在金屬容器中開水時，您會注意到氣泡開始來自最大加熱的區域。熱金屬傳遞瞭如此多的熱量，如此之快，接到水，以至於在水將熱量轉移到附近的水之前，它被轉化為蒸汽。這種蒸汽是您看到的泡沫。

What causes something to have a smell?,"Molecules from it break off and float around in the air. Your nose picks them up, and your olfactory center ""reads"" them. Yes this means exactly what you think it means, when you smell pooWe can smell things because particles are released from the substance. These particles diffuse into the air, and then we breath them in through our noses where they interact with special receptors that send signals to our brains. Our brains interpret these signals as smell sensations.I love to share with people the fact that if you can smell something, it's because you are inhaling some of it.

"I'm British. How could Greece defaulting on its loan repayment and leaving the eurozone affect me, the rest of the EU and the global economy?","For one thing, some of that debt is owed to UK banks and institutions. They will have to take a loss, which could mean everything to high interest rates to outright bank failures. It will heard the economies of the EU in general, and those are some of the UK biggest trading partners. One the other hand, the weakened euro might make the pound more attractive, which could boost the UK economy.If Greece defaults on its loan payments, the following might happen : 1. It sets up a bad precedent. Perhaps it will encourage other countries to borrow too much money and do risky things in the future. If Greece doesn't have to repay its loans, why should other countries? 2. It means Greece will have difficulty borrowing any money for a long time. If they decided not to pay back these loans, they might not pay back similar loans in the future. 3. It means people will be more pessimistic in the state of the Greek economy and Greek's trading partners, and by extension in the global economy; such pessimism can hurt stock markets. 4. It means Greece will not pay back the entities it owes money to, which may include your country. 5. Other countries may be more likely to emulate Greece and default on their payments. 5. Other countries may be more likely to leave the Eurozone for other reasons when times are bad, sticking Britain with the bill for their mistakes.

"Why in ancient times anything but a pure wife was rejected, but some men married widows?","Men didn't prefer virgins because they got to be the first. It was about legacy. Everything they had and were would be passed on to a son, and they wanted to make sure that boy really was his son. Marrying a virgin helped ensure this. Not only could the husband be sure she was not pregnant with another man's child, but she had followed the norm of society, and could be expected to continue to do so when married. Conversely, a woman known to have had sex out of marriage defied society, was considered a harlot who could not be trusted to remain faithful. In this scheme, a widow is almost as good as a virgin. She followed the rules and just had an unlucky break, so there was no reason to believe she would be any less faithful. Also, widows often inherited their husband's property and were more wealthy than a young woman still living with her family.",為什麼在遠古時代，除純粹的妻子以外的任何東西被拒絕了，但是有些男人已婚？,男人不喜歡處女，因為他們必須成為第一個。這是關於遺產的。他們擁有的一切都將被傳給一個兒子，他們想確保那個男孩真的是他的兒子。嫁給處女有助於確保這一點。丈夫不僅可以確定她沒有懷孕另一個男人的孩子，而且還遵循了社會規範，並且可以期望結婚後繼續這樣做。相反，一名已知出於婚姻不違背社會發生性行為的婦女被認為是一個頑強的人，她不能相信保持忠實。在此計劃中，寡婦幾乎和處女一樣好。她遵守規則，只是休息了不幸，所以沒有理由相信她會忠實的。此外，寡婦經常繼承丈夫的財產，比仍然與家人住在一起的年輕女子更富有。

What is on the papers that news anchors are continuously shuffling?,"Newsreaders usually have a small screen under the camera. On that screen, the text they read out is shown. This screen is called a ""teleprompter"". But in case the prompter breaks, they have the same text with them on paper, so they can continue reading the newsIIRC it comes from the days when newsreaders actually used written notes. A newsreader misjudged his timing and turned to speak to his colleague at the end of the programme whilst the cameras were still rolling. He did what a lot of people would do naturally at the end of a meeting: picked up the paper, shuffled them and tapped them on the desk. Apparently this action scored so highly with focus groups that it the became standard activity for newsreaders the world over.sw66sw answered it but I'll explain the shuffling. The papers are the entire show in text form. Everything is loaded in to the teleprompter which they read but if that breaks they can read along. the reason they are shuffling them is that they have to keep up with the teleprompter. If, for instance, one story takes up a page of text then at the end of reading the story they need to flip to the next page. If they didn't keep up and the prompter died you would see them flip through 20 pages to try and find their place.",報紙上有什麼新聞主播不斷改組？,新聞閱讀器通常在相機下面有一個小屏幕。在該屏幕上，顯示了他們讀出的文本。此屏幕稱為“遠程編譯器”。但是，如果提示者斷裂，他們在紙上有相同的文字，因此他們可以繼續閱讀新聞雜誌，這是從新聞閱讀器實際使用書面筆記的日子。一位新聞閱讀器誤判了他的時間，並在計劃結束時轉向同事交談，而相機仍在滾動。他做了很多人在會議結束時自然而然地做的事情：拿起紙，洗牌並在桌子上輕拍它們。顯然，這一動作在焦點小組中得分很高，以至於它成為全世界新聞閱讀器的標準活動。SW66SW回答了這一點，但我會解釋一下調整。論文是整個文本形式的整個節目。所有內容都加載到他們閱讀的遠程編譯器中，但是如果破裂，他們可以隨時閱讀。他們改道他們的原因是他們必須跟上傳送者。例如，如果一個故事佔用了一頁文本，那麼在閱讀故事結束時，他們需要翻轉下一頁。如果他們不跟上，求職者死了，您會看到他們翻閱20頁，試圖找到自己的位置。

"Theoretically, shouldn't a pyramid scheme work?","Pyramid schemes are 100% effective so long as the number of people joining exceeds the number of people who are already involved. This works because you can use the joiners money to pay off the oldest members. The problem is that the number of fools is a finite number. Eventually the scheme cannot maintain cash flowBasically here is how it works. Take a look at this picture. _URL_0_ What this picture is showing us is how pyramid schemes work. It is a system of recruitment. Pyramid schemes show us a company with some made up purpose that ultimately can't make money on it's products alone. The way it makes money is by having people buy into the company as ""members"". One person starts at the top and recruits however many people into the company. He/she get's these members to buy into the company via 100$ or whatever. He/she tells these new members that if they recruit new members they will get a margin of the profit. They might make 50$ off of each new member, while they other 50$ goes to the higher level. The problem is that by the time a member has recruit 5 members who went on to recruit another 5 who went on to recruit another 5 who all keep going on to recruit another 5, you run out of world population within a couple weeks. Then the pyramid collapses because money is no longer being passed up the chain of command and 95% of the members make no profit. Also the amount that members make from pyramid schemes ultimately is not that much anyways compared to if they graduated college and got a real job.Minor correction: Vemma is a not strictly a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level marketing. The difference is that in MLM there's an actual product being sold, so the company has actual revenues. MLM, while controversial, is sustainable and legal, and some MLM companies have existed for decades.It depends on where you are in the pyramid.

How reaction wheels (gyroscopes) in spacecraft work? How do they produce force?,"The simple answer is because of Newton's laws. They actually aren't using any of the special properties of gyroscopes. If you apply a force with an electric motor to a heavy disk, you are also applying an opposite force to the object the motor is mounted to. Same thing if you apply a force using a set of brakes. That opposite force is what you are really after when maneuvering a space craft. Here's a video showing this in Earth gravity: _URL_0_ You should note also that it is possible to use these disks as gyroscopes in order to maneuver. In that case, you most likely will want to use gyroscopic precession to apply force. That's a property where applying force to a gyroscope to tilt its axis of spin will result in another force acting 90* around the gyroscopes axis of spin. This is actually how helicopters control their orientation. By tilting the blades of the rotors up **on one side of the helicopter**, they can produce a force that lifts or lowers **the front** of the rotor disk.",航天器中的反應輪（陀螺儀）如何工作？他們如何產生力？,一個簡單的答案是因為牛頓的定律。實際上，他們沒有使用陀螺儀的任何特殊特性。如果將帶有電動機的力施加到重盤上，則您還將與安裝到的物體相反。同樣的事情，如果您使用一組制動器施加力。當您操縱太空飛船時，相反的力量是您真正追求的。這是一個在地球重力中顯示的視頻：_url_0_您還應注意，可以將這些磁盤用作陀螺儀進行操作。在這種情況下，您很可能需要使用陀螺術進行武力。這是一種屬性，將力施加到陀螺儀傾斜其自旋軸將導致另一種作用在旋轉旋轉軸周圍作用90*。這實際上就是直升機控制其方向的方式。通過將轉子的葉片傾斜**在直升機的一側**，它們可以產生抬高或降低轉子磁盤前**的力。
Why is a baby not nine months old when its born?,"Because it's called a ""birth""day - we define your age as being measured by your date of birth. We do that because it's easier to know for sure the day that the baby came out of the mom than the day that the sperm hit the egg. Even with all our technology, there's no real 100% way to know ""Oh yeah, this was fertilized on May 8th."" So we base our date on what we know, and everything works out about the sameBecause there is not a concrete date of conception that can be confirmed. Some infants are born later than 9 months of development, and some are born earlier. So we calculate age from a concrete date and time which is the birth.Not all babies are born at 9 months. It's just a accepted term because most babies are born around nine months of gestation",為什麼嬰兒出生時不九個月？,因為這被稱為“出生”一天 - 我們將您的年齡定義為按您的出生日期來衡量的。我們這樣做是因為比精子擊中雞蛋的那一天，嬰兒從媽媽出來的那一天要容易得多。即使有了我們所有的技術，也沒有真正的100％知道“哦，是的，這是在5月8日被施肥”。因此，我們將日期基於我們所知道的，並且一切都在相同的問題上奏效，因為沒有具體的受孕日期可以確認。一些嬰兒出生於9個月的發育時間晚，有些則出生於早期。因此，我們從出生的具體日期和時間開始計算年齡，而不是所有嬰兒出生於9個月。這只是一個公認的術語，因為大多數嬰兒在妊娠九個月內出生

what in our brain makes the auto alarm clock go off?,"This is an extremely complex part of biology. The processes your body uses for internal time keeping is called the circadian rhythm. Your circadian rhythm is affected by many different things such as hormone levels and balances within your brain, which in turn can be affected by external stimuli such as temperature and light. These hormone levels are controlled by a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, located in the hypothalamus. At the very basic the suprachiasmatic nucleus is stimulated during the day time via a nerve pathway from the retina of your eye during exposure to light. When it gets dark, this signal stops and the suprachiasmatic nucleus turns the pineal gland on; which starts to produce melatonin. The melatonin relaxes the body and causes you to start to feel tired. In the morning, when it starts to get light again, the pineal gland is switched off and the levels of melatonin in your blood start to decrease again; causing you to become more alert. Those are the basics anyway, how the body is able to determine time to an accurate enough level to wake you up within 5 minutes before your alarm goes off, I do not know. I'd be interested for someone to chip in with more detail. :)",在我們的大腦中，自動鬧鐘熄滅了？,這是生物學的一個極其複雜的部分。您的身體在內部時間內使用的過程稱為晝夜節律。您的晝夜節律受到許多不同事物的影響，例如大腦中的激素水平和平衡，這又可能受到外部刺激（例如溫度和光線）的影響。這些激素水平由位於下丘腦中的大腦的一部分控制，稱為上核。在非常基本的情況下，在暴露於光線期間，在白天通過眼睛的視網膜刺激了肌核。當它變黑時，該信號停止，肩部核核將鬆果體打開。開始產生褪黑激素。褪黑激素會放鬆身體，使您開始感到疲倦。早晨，當它再次發光時，松果體會關閉，血液中的褪黑激素水平再次開始降低。使您變得更加機敏。無論如何，這些都是基本知識，我不知道，身體如何確定時間到足夠準確的水平，在警報響起之前的5分鐘內喚醒您。我很感興趣的人更詳細地進來。:)
"What is actually going on with the oil companies, and why do the prices keep dropping?","all of these answers contain somewhat true points, but something to point out -- no one 'sets' oil prices, not the oil exploration and production companies, not OPEC, not anyone except the market. The two types of oil quoted when people talk about 'oil prices' are WTI and Brent Crude and these prices are set by futures contracts that are traded instruments. In other words, the price of oil is determined in much the same way the price of a stock is determined, not like the price of a good/service is determined. OPEC decided not to cut production , which had the effect of driving prices down , but they do not actually decide what price they will be able to sell a barrel of oil.",石油公司實際上發生了什麼，為什麼價格會不斷下跌？,所有這些答案都包含一些真實的觀點，但要指出的是 - 沒有人“設定”石油價格，而不是石油勘探和生產公司，而不是歐佩克，沒有其他人。當人們談論“石油價格”的兩種類型的石油是WTI和布倫特原油，這些價格是由交易工具的期貨合約確定的。換句話說，石油價格的確定方式與確定股票價格的方式相同，而不是確定良好/服務的價格。歐佩克決定不削減生產，這產生了降低價格的影響，但他們實際上並未決定他們將能夠出售一桶石油的價格。
what antibodies and reagents are,"An antibody is a protein produced by the body to combat disease. The antibodies will attach to the outside of a virus, coating it and making it inactive. A virus coated in antibodies can't infect other cells. A reagent is chemical added to a mixture that allows a reaction to occur but is not consumed in the process.",什麼是抗體和試劑,抗體是人體產生的蛋白質來對抗疾病。抗體將附著在病毒的外部，將其塗覆並使其不活躍。在抗體中塗有的病毒無法感染其他細胞。試劑被化學添加到混合物中，該混合物允許發生反應，但在此過程中不消耗。
How does the extra printed money from quantitative easing get into circulation?,"It's created electronically, and then used to buy bonds. Because those bonds are now owned, they can't be bought by the private investors anymore, so they have to go put their money other places instead.",定量寬鬆的額外印刷貨幣如何流通？,它是通過電子方式創建的，然後用來購買債券。由於這些債券現在已擁有，因此不再由私人投資者購買，因此他們必須將錢放在其他地方。
"Why do most promotions say ""Purchase Not Necessary""?","If a purchase is necessary to enter the game of chance the promotion is classified as a lottery. Some governments, such as the US and the UK, deem as illegal. You should be able to get a piece for free by going to your local McDonalds and stating you'd like to enroll without a purchase. Your request must then legally be obliged, possibly with a postage paid form that you fill out and mail in and they will, in turn, will mail you a piece. I am not certain how frequently you can do this, but I believe it's once per day per household.",為什麼大多數促銷活動都說“不需要購買”？,如果需要購買才能進入機會遊戲，則將促銷歸類為彩票。一些政府，例如美國和英國，認為是非法的。您應該能夠通過去當地的麥當勞並說明您想在不購買的情況下註冊，可以免費獲得一件。然後，您的請求必須在法律上有義務，可能會帶有您填寫和郵寄的郵資付費表格，然後他們將又會郵寄一件。我不確定您可以多久做一次，但我相信每個家庭每天一次。
Why do people call Fifty Shades of Gray porn?,"It's an erotic novel, which is about as close to porn as you can get while still being a novel. From what I understand, it goes into great detail about the intimacy involved.A better question is why we have the word ""Porn"" The word is a pejorative for anything of a sexual nature that you may disagree with. ""I can describe an axe entering the human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice at it. I provide a similar description, just as detailed, of a penis entering a vagina, and I get letters about it and people swearing off. To my mind this is kind of frustrating, it’s madness. Ultimately, in the history of [the] world, penises entering vaginas have given a lot of people a lot of pleasure; axes entering skulls, well, not so much.” - A Song of Ice and Fire author, George R.R. Martin on American readers’ reactions to his sex scenes.",人們為什麼稱五十種灰色色情陰影？,這是一部色情小說，在仍然是一本小說的同時，它與色情片一樣接近色情。據我了解，它詳細介紹了所涉及的親密關係。一個更好的問題是，為什麼我們擁有“色情”一詞，這個詞對您可能不同意的性質的任何性質都是貶義的。“我可以描述一個明確的細節進入人類頭骨的斧頭，沒有人會眨眼兩次。我提供了一個類似的描述，就像詳細的陰莖進入陰道一樣，我收到有關它的來信，我會收到有關它的來信。在我看來，這有點令人沮喪，這是瘋狂的。最終，在[世界]的歷史中，進入陰道的陰莖給了很多人很多樂趣；斧頭進入頭骨，好吧，不是那麼多。” - 《冰與火》作家喬治·R·R·馬丁（George R.R.

"How does hollywood accounting make a successful movie like Forrest Gump to be categorize as net loss, is it not true that box office - production office = profit?","Let's imagine that I'm making a film. It costs me $100million to make the film. And the film takes $300million at the box office. But of that $300million, the cinemas themselves keep $100million, so I get $200million. This sounds like $100million profit, right? I'm going to pay the screenwriter 10% of the profit. So he stands to make $10million. Not bad. But as well as spending $100million making the film, I also had to distribute the film to the cinemas. And arrange for it to be advertised. And I had to hire studios in which to film it. I decided to hire myself to distribute the film. I charged myself $40million for that. And I charged myself $40million for my expertise in arranging the advertising, too. Add to the the $30million I charged myself to hire my own studios, and you can see that the total cost of making the film was $210million. Even though over half those costs go to me. So why would I want to do that? Well, now there's no profit. And since the screenwriter's salary is a portion of the profit, I don't have to pay him anything at all! I've just saved myself $10million.",好萊塢會計如何使像Forrest Agump這樣的成功電影被歸類為淨損失，票房 - 生產辦公室=利潤不是真的嗎？,"讓我們想像我正在拍電影。製作這部電影，我花了我1億美元。這部電影在票房上花費了3億美元。但是在這3億美元的票房中，電影院本身保持了1億美元，所以我得到了2億美元。這聽起來像是1億美元的利潤，對嗎？我將向編劇支付10％的利潤。因此，他賺了1000萬美元。不錯。但是除了花1億美元製作這部電影外，我還必須將這部電影分發給電影院。並安排為其做廣告。我不得不聘請製片廠來拍攝它。我決定僱用自己分發電影。我為此指控自己4000萬美元。我也為自己的專業知識收取了4,000萬美元的費用。加上我自己收取的3000萬美元僱用自己的工作室的耗資，您可以看到製作這部電影的總成本為2.1億美元。即使這些費用超過一半也歸我。那我為什麼要這樣做呢？好吧，現在沒有利潤。而且由於編劇的薪水是利潤的一部分，因此我根本不必付錢給他！我剛剛節省了1000萬美元。"

Why do I become even more angrier at the person who really hurt me when they try to be nice to me or offer something nice when I'm upset?,Human instinct is to not repeat a task that hurts you. You have in some way opened up and allowed yourself to be hurt by this person. They hurt you and your natural reaction is to want to not be hurt again so when they try to be nice your brain doesn't want to open back up to them and give them another opportunity to hurt you. The easiest way to prevent yourself from opening back up is to be angry with them. It is one of the strongest emotions and the most difficult to change through reasonable thinking which makes it the go to emotion for when you are upset with someone.,為什麼當他們試圖對我友善或沮喪時提供一些好東西時，我對那些真正傷害我的人變得更加生氣？,人類的本能是不要重複一項傷害您的任務。您以某種方式打開了，讓自己受到此人的傷害。他們傷害了您，您的自然反應是要不要再次受到傷害，因此當他們試圖變得友善時，您的大腦不想向他們敞開心heak，並給他們另一個傷害您的機會。防止自己打開備份的最簡單方法是生氣。這是最強烈的情緒之一，也是最難通過合理思考改變的最難改變，這使您對某人感到不高興。
Why were ancient cities buried or abandoned if they continued to grow into modern cities?,"Some cities have been around for thousands of years, and still are inhabited today. Rome or example or Istanbul. Many cities were abandoned because of things like: 1. Natural Disasters2. Lack of/exhaustion of local resources3. Economic/Trade shifts', ""Well, look at your example, Corinth. It was sacked and burned by Rome, and its citizens put to the sword, leaving it largely uninhabited to fall into further ruin for years, before being rebuilt by Rome.

Captured by Byzantines. Then Ottomans again. Then Venetians. Then destroyed by the Turks. then owned by the Greeks, then another earthquake.

Why do we perceive our vision as a single frame when we have two eyes?,"We have binocular vision, by using two eyes our brain receives to separate images with everything shifted slightly left or right. Your brain then takes the images and process them together into a single image, using the differences to give you depth perception and three dimensional vision. For example I am sitting at my computer screen. If I close one eye, then quickly open and close the other my computer screen seems to shift, this is because it's close to me. If I look out the window at a tree down the street and do the same that jump is minimal or imperceptible. This tells me the tree is far away. Your brain is doing this in real time with the two images to constantly keep up our sense of depth.The above is extremely accurate! Im commenting just to tell you if stuff like this interest you I 'd suggest watching the show ""Brain Games"" they have an episode on how vision works! The show is on Netflix, enjoy!",當我們有兩隻眼睛時，為什麼我們將視野視為單一框架？,我們有雙眼視力，通過使用兩隻眼睛，我們的大腦收到的圖像將圖像分開，所有圖像略微向左或右移動。然後，您的大腦使用圖像並將它們一起處理為單個圖像，並使用差異為您提供深度感知和三維視覺。例如，我坐在電腦屏幕上。如果我閉上一隻眼睛，那麼快速打開並關閉另一個我的計算機屏幕似乎發生了變化，這是因為它離我很近。如果我在街上的一棵樹上看窗外，並且跳躍是最小或無法察覺的。這告訴我這棵樹很遠。您的大腦正在實時使用這兩個圖像，以不斷地保持我們的深度感。以上非常準確！我要評論只是告訴您是否有這樣的興趣，您建議您觀看節目“大腦遊戲”，他們有一個關於視覺如何工作的情節！該節目在Netflix上，享受！
Why does semen turn hard when exposed to hot water?,"The same reason eggs get more solid when they cook, I believe. The heat causes some of the proteins to denature. Proteins are kind of like balled-up organic strings. Since they are round, they easily bump past each other in a liquid. When they denature, they partially or completely unravel, and the loose ends get all tangled up with each other, creating a more solid structure.It's because the components of semen include different types of proteins which 1 is a coagulating protein and the other is a de-coagulating protein. The water apparently removes the de-coagulating protein quicker which would make the semen hard. Edit add:[wisegeek] has a good article.",為什麼精液在暴露於熱水時會努力呢？,我相信，雞蛋在烹飪時會變得更加堅固的原因。熱使一些蛋白質變性。蛋白質有點像蛋白質。由於它們是圓形的，因此它們很容易用液體碰到彼此。當它們變性時，它們會部分或完全解開，而鬆散的末端彼此糾結，創建更堅固的結構。這是因為精液的成分包括不同類型的蛋白質，1是一種凝結的蛋白質，另一個是一個去凝的蛋白質。水顯然可以更快地去除去凝的蛋白質，從而使精液變得難度。編輯添加：[Wisegeek]有一篇很好的文章。
LI5: Why wont the US government legalize marijuana?,"Legalizing marijuana is not a politically wise proposal to make. There are lots of reasons why this is so, but the core thing is that a politician would lose more votes from the minority that opposes marijuana than from the majority that supports it. As long as that is true, marijuana will not be legalized, no matter how strong the reasons are.Because a lot of people still oppose it, and because it would be akin to admitting that the War on Drugs was ineffective and a massive waste of money. It would cause a pretty seismic shift in the American legal system too. I expect you'd see a massive wave of conviction appeals, for example.",LI5：美國政府為什麼不將大麻合法化？,使大麻合法化不是政治明智的提議。這樣做的原因有很多，但是核心是政治家將失去反對大麻的少數派的選票，而不是支持大麻的大多數人。只要這是真的，無論原因有多強，大麻就不會合法化。錢。這也會導緻美國法律制度的巨大轉變。例如，我希望您會看到一波巨大的信念吸引力。
How is a SSN (Social Security Number) generated?,"Area numbers - The first three numbers originally represented the state in which a person first applied for a social security card. Numbers started in the northeast and moved westward. This meant that people on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest. Since 1972, the Social Security Administration has assigned numbers and issued cards based on the ZIP code in the mailing address provided on the original application form. Since the applicant's mailing address doesn't have to be the same as his residence, his area number doesn't necessarily represent the state in which he resides. For many of us who received our SSNs as infants, the area number indicates the state we were born in. You can find out which area numbers go with each state here. Group numbers - These two middle digits, which range from 01 through 99, are simply used to break all the SSNs with the same area number into smaller blocks to make administration easier. Serial numbers - Within each group designation, serial numbers -- the last four digits in an SSN -- run consecutively from 0001 through 9999.",SSN（社會保險號）是如何生成的？,區域數 - 前三個數字最初代表了一個人首先申請社會保險卡的狀態。數字從東北開始，向西移動。這意味著東海岸的人們的人數最低，西海岸的人們的人數最高。自1972年以來，社會保障局已根據原始申請表上提供的郵件地址中的郵政編碼分配了數字和發行卡。由於申請人的郵寄地址不一定與他的住所相同，因此他的面積號不一定代表他居住的州。對於我們許多作為嬰兒的SSN的人來說，面積數表示我們所出生的狀態。您可以在這裡發現哪個面積與哪個狀態相處。小組編號 - 這兩個中間數字範圍從01到99，僅用於將所有具有相同面積的SSN分解為較小的塊，以使管理更容易。序列號 - 在每個組指定中，序列號 -  SSN中的最後四位數字 - 從0001到9999連續運行。
How do trees survive winter?,"They can store nutrients below ground mostly. Think of syrup, which all decidious trees in northern climates produce. The flow of syrup is the tree moving sugars from its lower storage organs to its leaf buds yo support the new growth. Also woody tissue with secondary cell walls are dead so they aren't really supporting as much living tissue as it seems.",樹木如何生存冬天？,他們可以將營養存儲在大部分下方。想想糖漿，這是北部氣候中所有決定的樹。糖漿的流量是將糖從其下部儲存器官到其葉芽的移動糖，以支持新的生長。還有帶有次要細胞壁的木質組織死亡，因此它們並沒有真正支撐像看起來那麼多的活組織。
"Why in construction, when they lay rebar, is it in a grid pattern?","Because grids are easy and the structural integrity gained from triangles would not outway the massive extra time investment.With rebar being placed in concrete it is used to add tensile strength . The strength of rebar isn't utilized from the grid pattern itself but by the pieces parallel to each other resisting stretching caused by loads causing bending. Laying in a grid pattern is simply the most efficient way of adding support in the X-Y grid with Z loading. There are actually complex formulas based on loading, spans, material qualities, etc. but I'm assuming that's not what you came here for.",為什麼在構造中，當它們放置鋼筋時，它是一種網格模式？,因為網格很容易，並且從三角形獲得的結構完整性不會超過大量的額外時間投資。與混凝土一起放置鋼筋，它用於添加拉伸強度。鋼筋的強度不是從網格圖案本身中使用的，而是通過平行於彼此的碎片來抵抗由彎曲的負載引起的拉伸。鋪設網格模式只是在X-Y網格中添加Z加載的最有效方法。實際上，基於加載，跨度，物質質量等的複雜公式。但是我假設這不是您來這裡的目的。
Why does diarrhea make your anus burn.,"Several factors contribute to the feeling of burning, ranging from the following depending on your particular situation: * diarrhea poop is more acidic than normal poop. * reduced time in transit through your gut may also leave more digestive enzymes in diarrhea than regular poop* increased water content in your poop means that the entire contents are more easily smeared onto the surfaces of your mucous membranes. Normal poop is more desiccated and thus doesn't spread all the food contents over your rectum and anus.* The bacteria that live in your mid-gut may have been expelled more quickly than normal, meaning that the bacteria in diarrhea may be different than those in normal poop.* There are many immune cells that hang out near the rectum , and tissue inflammation is a common side effect of your immune cells detecting foreign substances. This doesn't happen as badly for regular poop because it is often more solid, and therefore less accessible. As described above, normal poop is also more alkaline, less digestive enzymes, and has normal bacteria in it. The combination of all these things, combined with the need for more wiping is the primary reason why diarrhea burns.Not to do with stomach acid, that should be neutralised before it gets anywhere near leaving your body . Probably because diarrhoea is wet and this, in addition to wiping more often than usual, irritates the skin around your butthole. Also, think about how babies get nappy rash from having wet nappies against their butts for extended periods, if you have wet soppy faeces because you couldn't clean it all properly it's going to start itching and irritating you.Because of rapid contractions and expansions of the anal skin. When you release an air filled balloon, its ""exit"", goes like [this]. If a balloon could feel, it 'd feel burn.Not sure on the accuracy of this one, but I've understood it to be, essentially muzzle velocity. I don't think I need to elaborate.none of this sounds very definitive. I didnt know I needed to know but now I do know that I need to know, I need to know.",為什麼腹瀉會使您的肛門燃燒。,幾個因素有助於燃燒的感覺，從以下情況取決於您的特定情況： *腹瀉便便比正常糞便更酸性。*與常規大便相比，通過腸道的過渡時間減少的時間也可能留下更多的消化酶。普通糞便更加干燥，因此不會將所有食物含量散佈在直腸和肛門上。*正常糞便中的那些。對於常規大便而言，這種情況並不是很糟糕，因為它通常更牢固，因此易於訪問。如上所述，正常糞便也更鹼性，消化酶較少，並且中有正常的細菌。所有這些東西的結合，再加上需要更多擦拭的需要是腹瀉燃燒的主要原因。不是與胃酸一起做，這應該被中和，然後才能到達離開身體的任何地方。可能是因為腹瀉是潮濕的，除了比平時更頻繁地擦拭外，還會刺激屁眼周圍的皮膚。另外，考慮一下嬰兒如何從濕尿布對屁股上濕napp的時間延長尿布，如果您有濕的糞便，因為您無法正確清潔它，它將開始發癢和刺激您。肛門皮。當您釋放充滿空氣的氣球時，它的“退出”會像[此]。如果氣球能感覺到，那就燃燒了。確定該氣球的準確性，但我理解是，本質上是槍口速度。我認為我不需要詳細說明。我不知道我需要知道，但是現在我確實知道我需要知道，我需要知道。

How is the melody encoded on a vinyl and how is it reproduced by a record player ?,"Such is the genius of Thomas Edison. It turns out sound waves are really pressure waves that exert force on your eardrums 'creating' sound. Vinyl is a soft material which is sensitive to subtle changes in force. Therefore to make a recording, an etching needle is placed on the vinyl and when sounds are made it moves the needle up and down according to the pressure exerted by the sound wave. As a result it literally converts a pressure wave into a physical shape. To play back, the opposite occurs. You run a needle over the record and the needle moves a diaphragm back and forth converting the 'shape' of the sound wave back into an actual sound.The awesome thing is that the music isn't ""encoded"" so much as directly represented on the vinyl. You are listening to the waves, bumps, dust and mites on the vinyl itself. Here's a [modern explanation] . However, I 'd highly recommend checking out [this video] as it details the making of shellac records . Which, if you didn't know, is made from resin excreted by a bug.",旋律如何在乙烯基上編碼，如何由唱片播放器複製？,這就是托馬斯·愛迪生的天才。事實證明，聲波確實是壓力波，它會在您的耳膜“創造”聲音上施加力。乙烯基是一種柔軟的材料，對實力的細微變化敏感。因此，為了製作記錄，將蝕刻針放在乙烯基上，當發出聲音時，它會根據聲波施加的壓力向上和向下移動。結果，它實際上將壓力波轉換為物理形狀。為了播放，相反的情況發生。您在記錄上跑一根針，針頭將隔膜移動到後方，將聲波的“形狀”轉換回實際的聲音。很棒的是，音樂不是“編碼”的，而是直接代表乙烯基。您正在聽乙烯基本身上的海浪，顛簸，灰塵和蟎蟲。這是一個[現代解釋]。但是，我強烈建議您查看[此視頻]，因為它詳細介紹了蟲膠記錄的製作。如果您不知道，那是由一個被錯誤排泄的樹脂製成的。
How did child rearing work before diapers?,"As far as infants, cloth and linen were often used as diapers, this is shown in native tribes. Disposable diapers are relatively new. Many people still use cloth diapers as they tend to be better for an infants skin. Thorough cleaning was just very importantPeople just used cloth which they had to wrap around the baby then wash when it was used. Same with tampons.",尿布之前的兒童養育如何工作？,至於嬰兒，布和亞麻通常用作尿布，這在本地部落中顯示。一次性尿布相對較新。許多人仍然使用布尿布，因為它們往往對嬰兒皮膚更好。徹底的清潔只是非常重要的人，只是使用了布料，他們必須在嬰兒周圍包裹，然後在使用時洗滌。與衛生棉條一樣。
"When naming a new royal, are there only certain names they are allowed to use or is it just assumed they'll use a previous royal name?","It comes down to custom and tradition. For instance, with British royalty, they need to pick a British name. Custom dictates they can't go with something like Barbara or Fleur. Custom shows that typically they choose names to honor other family members or royalty. That's how they chose Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Diana as the three names for the Princess. You want something with historical significance and personal significance.",當命名新的皇室時，是否只有某些名字可以使用，還是只是假設他們會使用以前的皇家名稱？,這取決於習俗和傳統。例如，使用英國皇室，他們需要選擇一個英國名字。自定義決定他們不能與芭芭拉或芙蓉之類的東西一起去。自定義表明，通常他們會選擇名稱來紀念其他家庭成員或皇室成員。這就是他們選擇夏洛特，伊麗莎白和戴安娜作為公主的三個名字的方式。您想要具有歷史意義和個人意義的東西。
"According to the BBC: pilots used the aircrafts' sensors to confirm ""no civilians were in the proximity of the targets"" In the Syrian Bombings. How?","It basically means ""We hit the designated target. The target was defined as hostile, therefore everybody there were enemies. If there were any civilians, we define them as enemies as well."". In other words, they only know that the bombs hit as intended, they don't know who was there or if the intelligence that selected the target was correctBelieve it or not, there's an incredible amount of people involved in planning a kinetic strike. There is a whole section of doctrine describing the targeting cycle, and it's not trivial, nor is dropping a bomb on areas with people in them okay as long as the ""intended targets"" are in the mix. It's the exact reason ISIL like hiding behind civilians. They understand our targeting doctrine and use it against us. When they mentioned sensors, notice they mentioned other ISR assets supporting the strike. This is most likely where the information came from in this situation. But also understand that this probably was not the first time they had eyes on the target or the people around it. Weeks or months of planning lead up to a few PowerPoints to big wigs explaining why something should be targeted and how.

So, acid and bile are being created and released into the stomach and intestines. Just sitting around not doing anything is sometimes, in some individuals, irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. This irritation stimulates vomiting as the body does not realize the cause of the irritation, and tries to get it out of the body. In animals , this is known as bilious vomiting syndrome. The best way to treat it is feeding smaller, more frequent meals; or at the very least giving a bit of a snack before bedtime. Source: I am a veterinarianNothing but bile, right?

"What does it mean as Paul Halmos says in his Naive Set Theory that ""nothing contains everything""","It simply means that there's no set that contains every possible element, and that we can't arbitrarily define any set we want. Set theory defines objects called ""sets"", which are simply collections of elements. For a given set, every possible element either is or isn't in this set. So given a set and an element, we can ask whether the element is contained in the set. How do we define sets? Well, we can define X = ""The set of all positive integers"". So 1, 2 and 3 are members of that set, but -1, 1/2, ""cat"" and ""air"" aren't. We can take a set X and derive a new set from it. For example, we can say Y = ""every number in X that is divisible by 3"", and we get that set that contains 3, 6, 9 and so on. Sets can also be members of another set: for example, we can define X to be a set that contains the set {1,2} . The question is, can we arbitrarily define any set we want? The answer is no, because that causes a paradox. ""Nothing contains everything"" says that we can't define a set that contains everything. That is, a set X such that for every element E, E is a member of X. The proof is similar to Russell's Paradox: we define a new set Y to be ""every element in X that doesn't contain itself"". Is Y a member of X? If it is, then it means that Y doesn't contains itself. But according to the definition of Y, it means that Y does contain itself - we got ourselves a contradiction. So that means Y isn't a member of X - which contradicts the assumption that X is a set that contains everything.",保羅·霍爾莫斯（Paul Halmos,"這只是意味著沒有包含所有可能元素的集合，並且我們不能任意定義我們想要的任何集合。集理論定義了稱為“集合”的對象，這只是元素的集合。對於給定的集合，每個可能的元素都在此集合中。因此，鑑於集合和元素，我們可以詢問該元素是否包含在集合中。我們如何定義集合？好吧，我們可以定義x =“所有正整數的集合”。因此，1、2和3是該集合的成員，但是-1、1/2，“ cat”和“ air”不是。我們可以採用一組X並從中得出新集。例如，我們可以說y =“ x中的每個數字都可以由3”，並且我們得到包含3、6、9等的集合。集合也可以是另一組的成員：例如，我們可以將X定義為包含集合{1,2}的集合。問題是，我們可以任意定義想要的任何集合嗎？答案是否定的，因為這會導致悖論。“沒有什麼包含所有內容”說，我們無法定義包含所有內容的集合。也就是說，對於每個元素E，E是X的成員。證明類似於Russell的悖論：我們將新集合y定義為“ x中不包含自己的每個元素”。Y是X的成員嗎？如果是這樣，則意味著y不包含自己。但是根據Y的定義，這意味著Y確實包含了自己 - 我們使自己矛盾。因此，這意味著Y不是X的成員 - 它與X是包含所有內容的集合的假設相矛盾。"

Why does building a robot like the mars rover cost so much money?,"Are you talking about the Curiosity rover that is said to have cost $2.5 billion? If so, some clarification might be warranted. NASA spread the $2.5 billion figure over eight years. The money spent went into salaries of engineers, programmers, managers, and independent contractors in over twenty states across the country. And even some from out of country. Things like the cost of rocket to launch it to Mars are included in that total, too, which accounts for nearly a fifth of the amount alone. If you you just divide the total cost by the number of years NASA has saved for it, you come out with about $312 million per year. This works about to approximately 1.8% of NASA’s yearly budget. That’s about $1 per year for every American. When put into context of the federal budget, it's actually quite cheap.",為什麼建造像火星漫遊者這樣的機器人花了這麼多錢？,您是在談論好奇的流浪者，據說耗資25億美元？如果是這樣，可能有必要進行一些澄清。NASA在八年內傳播了25億美元的數字。花費的錢用於全國二十多個州的工程師，程序員，經理和獨立承包商的薪水。甚至有一些來自國外的地方。諸如火箭發射到火星的成本之類的東西也包括在該總數中，僅佔僅佔該金額的近五分之一。如果您只是將總成本除以NASA為此節省的年數，那麼您每年的價格約為3.12億美元。這項工作約佔NASA年度預算的1.8％。每個美國人每年約1美元。當納入聯邦預算的背景下，實際上很便宜。

Why are programs allowed to use 100% CPU ?,"We bought the CPU to be used, not to sit idle. If one program wants all of the CPU and no other programs want any, why would the program that wants it not be given it? The CPU doesn't have inertia. If someone else comes along and asks for CPU, it can be taken away from the first process in a tiny fraction of a second.On desktop, this is allowed because often hogging CPU is precisely what program is supposed to do, for example games, or video editing.

On servers, where multiple important programs share the same hardware, you can set up CPU, memory and i/o quotas, which are enforced these days through virtualization . This, however, is no easy task to do correctly, and requires a rather specific expertise. Also server-grade hardware and software, which is expensive compared to regular desktop stuff.It does, don't think it doesn't.

How do G force suits work?,"The compress the body in an attempt to keep the blood from leaving your head, which is what causes blackouts at high GsAs dancingwithcats said the suit helps constrict certain parts of your body to hinder the blood flow so the pressure is higher in the upper body. Higher G forces will literally draw the blood away from your head or at least prevent it from flowing effectively throughout your brain hence you passing out . As such pilots are trained also to tighten the muscles around their thighs to help increase their tolerance. The suit then helps enhance their level even higher. I cannot remember the exact number but the training can increase the body tolerance by 2g and the suit can increase it a couple more. However there is a threshold of which every human being will fail at no matter what', ""G suits are actually by pilots when they do high G maneuvers, not from breaking the sound barrier. You can pull high G's at relatively slow speeds. When you are pulling high positive Gs, the forces are pulling blood down from the top of your body to your bottom extremities. This means your head gets less blood and thus less oxygen than it needs to keep you from passing out - you end up experiencing things like tunnel vision, muffled hearing, and then eventually greying out/blacking out and G-LOC . G-suits are worn by pilots. These are essentially wrapped around your abdominals and legs and contain internal pouches. The G-suit has a hose which the pilot connects to a valve in the cockpit. When high Gs are pulled, pressurized bleed air from the engine goes through the hose into the pouches in the suit, inflating them. Think of it like blowing air into a balloon and having it inflate. When the pouches inflate, they push on your abdominals and legs thus creating pressure that helps fight blood flowing down to your legs, making you more resistant to G-forces.",G部隊套件如何工作？,壓縮身體以防止血液離開頭部，這是導致高GSAS DancingwithCats停電的原因，他說這套西裝有助於收縮身體的某些部位，以阻止血液流動，因此上半身的壓力更高。較高的G力實際上會將血液從您的頭部遠離，或者至少阻止其在整個大腦中有效地流動，從而散發出來。因此，對此類飛行員進行了訓練，以擰緊大腿周圍的肌肉，以幫助增加其容忍度。然後，這套西裝有助於提高其水平甚至更高的水平。我不記得確切的數字，但是訓練可以增加2G的身體耐受性，而西裝可以增加幾個。然而，有一個門檻，每個人無論是什麼都會失敗的''，“ G訴訟實際上是飛行員進行高G演習時，而不是打破聲音障礙。您正在拉高陽性GS，力量將血從身體的頂部拉到底端。這意味著您的頭部流血少，因此氧氣少於阻止您脫穎而出的氧氣 - 您最終會遇到東西就像隧道視覺一樣，聽力低沉，然後最終灰色/塗黑和G-loc。飛行員連接到駕駛艙中的閥門。當拔出高高的GS時，發動機的加壓空氣通過軟管進入西裝中的袋中，使其充氣。將其膨脹，就像將空氣吹入氣球中並使其充氣。當小袋膨脹時，它們會推向您的腹部和腿部，從而產生壓力，有助於與血液流向腿部，從而使您對G-Forces更具抵抗力。
"The different ""grades"" of gas, and how much it really matters.","In one part of how a car engine works, a piston squeezes a mixture of gasoline and air, then a spark plug sets it on fire at a precise time. But squeezing that mixture makes it hot, and sometimes it can make it *so* hot that it catches fire before the right time. This can push the engine backward, hurts your gas mileage, and wears out the engine too soon. It's called knocking, or engine knock. It's most common in sports cars, where, to get a little bit more power when the engine is working right, it's designed to squeeze the gasoline-air mixture more tightly than other engines do. Now, gasoline is made up mainly of two kinds of stuff: hexane and octane. Fuels with more octane can get squeezed into less space, at higher temperatures, before they catch fire.

The Moon is the name that’s been approved by the International Astronomical Union , which is the internationally recognized body for naming anything outside of Earth’s atmosphere. The Moon is called as such because it doesn't need any other name. It’s not just any moon, it’s *the* Moon.

Why do countries have different voltage for appliances ?,"First, I believe you mistyped and meant 120/240v in the US. There is a trade-off between voltage and power lost due to resistance. Very few things in your house use even 120v, so why so much voltage? First you need to know some simple concepts about electricity. For a certain amount of power running through a wire, you can increase the current by decreasing the voltage and vice vera, according to this formula: Power= Voltage * Current So if I have a cable with 120v at 2 amps of current, and another line with 240v at 1 amp, those two cables are carrying the same amount of electricity. It's like two streams, one is twice as wide as the other, but the thinner one is twice as fast. So why choose one over the other? This brings us to our last electrical concept: The power lost to heat from the resistance of the wire we use is based on the CURRENT only. The more current, the more energy lost to heat caused by the resistance of the conductor. Now the reason we use high-power lines is clear, transporting electricity at high voltages and stepping the voltage down close to where it is used is more efficient. In the end the precise voltages you use are arbitrary, as Mr. JelloTree said, but once you commit, you can bet a power network isn't going to want to change, as there are massive economies of scale in keeping components standard.",為什麼國家的電器電壓不同？,首先，我相信您是錯誤的，在美國意味著120/240V。由於電阻而導致的電壓和電源之間的權衡是一個權衡的。您家中很少有人使用120V，那麼為什麼這麼多電壓呢？首先，您需要了解有關電力的一些簡單概念。對於通過電線運行的一定量的功率，您可以通過降低電壓和VICE VERA來增加電流，根據此公式：電源=電壓 *電流在1安培時與240V排隊，這兩根電纜載有相同數量的電力。它就像兩個流，一個是另一個流的兩倍，但較薄的速度是兩倍。那麼，為什麼選擇一個呢？這使我們進入了最後的電氣概念：由於我們使用的電線的電阻而損失的功率僅基於電流。電流越多，由於導體的阻力引起的熱量損失的能量就越多。現在，我們使用高功率線的原因是清晰的，以高壓運輸電力，並將電壓向下降低到所使用的位置的效率更高。最後，您使用的確切電壓是任意的，正如Jellotree先生所說，但是一旦提交，您可以押注電源網絡不想更改，因為有大量規模經濟可以使組件標準化。

Why is the Euro more valuable than the American Dollar?,"It doesn't really matter if one number is bigger than the other number. What matters is how many Euros you get and how much stuff you can buy with a Euro. So if I have 3 Euros, but it costs me 3 Euros to buy some candy, then I have no more Euros left! But if I have $2 and it only costs $1 to buy some candy then I have a dollar left over! So even though the Euro is a bigger number, what really matters is how much stuff you can buy with that amount. So we now know two things: How much can I buy with a euro vs how much can I buy with a USD. And we know how many dollars it costs to buy a euro. So if I can buy a piece of candy for 3 euros or $1, and I can $2 for one Euro, then I'm much better off selling my Euros to buy dollars because that way I'll be able to get a LOT more candy. Very smart people who run banks and businesses are aware of this, and so they trade euros for dollars all the time to the extent that the amount of stuff you can buy with euros vs the amount of stuff you can buy with dollars is in proportion to how many euros you can buy per dollar. In the perfect world, this means that you can't just trade dollars for euros and therefore buy more stuff. But sometimes people have other reasons for buying dollars instead of euros or vice versa . If people have a strong reason to prefer one currency over the other that is not related to how much candy that currency can buy, then that currency is considered to be overvalued. If a currency is significantly overvalued, it means that people are knowingly giving themselves a bad deal because they are nervous about the future of the undervalued currency. Not quite ELI5 link here: _URL_0_",為什麼歐元比美元更有價值？,一個數字是否比另一個數字大，這並不重要。重要的是，您可以獲得多少歐元，以及可以用歐元購買多少歐元。因此，如果我有3歐元，但是我花了3歐元購買一些糖果，那麼我再也沒有歐元了！但是，如果我有2美元，只花1美元買一些糖果，那麼我還剩一美元！因此，即使歐元是更大的數字，但真正重要的是您可以用這個數量購買多少東西。因此，我們現在知道了兩件事：我可以用歐元而購買多少錢，我可以用美元購買多少。而且我們知道購買歐元花費了多少美元。因此，如果我可以以3歐元或1美元的價格購買一塊糖果，而我可以買2美元，那麼我最好把歐元賣給購買美元，因為那樣，我將能夠得到更多的糖果。經營銀行和企業的非常聰明的人意識到這一點，因此他們一直以歐元的價格交易歐元，以至於您可以用歐元購買的東西與您可以買入的東西的數量與美元購買的數量與您每美元可以購買多少歐元。在完美的世界中，這意味著您不能僅以歐元的價格將美元交易，因此可以購買更多東西。但是有時人們有其他購買美元而不是歐元的原因，反之亦然。如果人們有充分的理由希望一種貨幣而不是一種與貨幣可以購買的糖果無關的貨幣，那麼該貨幣被認為被高估了。如果貨幣被大大高估，則意味著人們有明智地給自己一筆不錯的交易，因為他們對被低估的貨幣的未來感到緊張。在這裡不完全eli5鏈接：_url_0_

Tattoos have been seen as unprofessional in Western society for ages. They 've become vastly more acceptable in the last few decades.It's because of the customers, if the customers didn't care the businesses wouldn't either. I work in a service where I travel from house to house, when I first started I had earnings and tattoos. I went in to the office to quit at the end of my first week, it was rough and the Customers were horrible. My boss told me no, I wasn't quitting. What I was going to do was try the next week without my earnings and longer sleeves to cover my tattoos. Then after that I could do what I want. I'm glad I took his advice, it was a start to the vest job I ever had. Attitudes were drastically different, I was welcome and treated as a friend. People can be pretty petty, and a business has to make their customers happy.",為什麼如今，許多公司都將紋身視為“不專業”？,因為在現代歷史上，紋身的人們經常是與不愉快的組織，犯罪和暴力有關的人們。我認為您可以理解為什麼希望展示專業和安全的環境的公司會迴避僱用那些紋身的公司。儘管如今，許多患有紋身的人絕不與“如今的暴力或犯罪”相關，但這種普遍的態度已經傳下來，儘管現在可能不像過去那樣適用。紋身在西方學會中被視為不專業。在過去的幾十年中，他們變得更加可接受。這是因為客戶，如果客戶不關心企業也不會。我在一個服務的服務中工作，當我剛開始時，我有收入和紋身。在第一周結束時，我去辦公室辭職，這很艱難，顧客很恐怖。我的老闆告訴我不，我沒有辭職。我要做的就是在下週嘗試沒有收入和更長的袖子來掩蓋我的紋身。然後，我可以做我想做的事。我很高興我接受了他的建議，這是我從事過的背心工作的開始。態度截然不同，歡迎我被視為朋友。人們可能會變得很瑣碎，一家企業必須使客戶滿意。
"Gabriel's horn, having trouble visualizing it.","Well, you could just consider it being made of lego blocks instead. Each block with length of 1 along x-axis, first one that covers the entire horn from x=1 to x=2 would have side length of 2 * 1. Basically, you're approximating upwards, so that lego is bigger than it needs to be near x=2 but that's fine. So lego block has length 1, and two other dimensions are 2 * 1, so it has volume of 4 Next lego block from x = 2 to x = 3 would have to have side length of 2 * 1/2, so total volume 4 * 1/4 = 1. Next lego, side length 2 * 1/3, so 4 * 1/9. The next one, 4 * 1/16. So basically, our lego blocks have volumes 4 * 1/x^2 So volume of Gabriels horn has to be smaller than the lego blocks that contain it, which form neat series 4 * . Sum of inverses of squares is finite, so maybe that helps?",Gabriel的喇叭很難可視化它。,好吧，您可以認為它是由樂高積木製成的。每個塊沿x軸的長度為1，第一個覆蓋整個喇叭從x = 1到x = 2的塊的側面長度為2 * 1.。基本上，您要近似向上，因此樂高需要接近x = 2，但這很好。因此，樂高塊的長度為1，另外兩個維度為2 * 1，因此它的體積為4個LEGO塊，從x = 2到x = 3，側面長度必須為2 * 1/2，因此總體積4* 1/4 = 1。下一個樂高，側長2 * 1/3，因此4 * 1/9。下一個，4 * 1/16。因此，基本上，我們的樂高塊具有4 * 1/x^2的體積，因此gabriels horn的體積必須小於包含它的樂高塊，形成整齊的序列4 *。正方形的倒置的總和是有限的，所以可能會有所幫助？
"instead of fighting green energy, why don't coal and gas companies invest in it?","The current energy companies have every motivation to get in on ""green energy "". There are just a few problems: It is more expensive to produce than traditional fossil fuels, or only effective in a few areas or times, or doesn't have the necessary capacity. Often the only reason we see green energy is because of government subsidies. From the traditional energy companies\' standpoint this is just passing a law to take money from people and give it to their competitors. As they see it they have a superior product; more powerful, more flexible, more reliable, and less expensive. If ""Big Oil"" could make or buy solar panels and provide electricity to their customers at a lower cost than digging up oil then they would; however greedy and sadistic you want to paint them, at least trust that they wouldn't throw money away. Many big energy companies are accused of buying up green energy concepts and squashing them, never to be seen again. The companies want in on the next big thing early, but what they find is an inferior product that doesn't stand on its own without government intervention. They retain the tech but keep selling what the market wants: The least expensive solution. That is oil, for now.Energy companies HAVE invested in 'green energy' and are doing so right now. However, the necessary capital to get green energy is too much and the profit margins from them are too slim. The main reasons Green Energy is attempted at the moment is due to the government forcing it and also the publicity these companies receive. This is not to say there will be a point on time when green energy becomes a more lucrative investment . Concluding: You will always hear people calling the energy companies evil . However, when people complain companies should drop fossil fuels it is necessary in keep in mind the extra cost YOU will be paying extra for it due to the extra cost the energy companies must pay.",煤炭和天然氣公司為什麼不投資綠色能源？,目前的能源公司有一切動力進入“綠色能源”。只有一些問題：生產比傳統化石燃料更昂貴，或者僅在幾個區域或時間有效，或者沒有必要的能力。通常，我們看到綠色能源的唯一原因是由於政府補貼。從傳統的能源公司的角度來看，這只是通過一項法律來從人們那裡獲取錢並將其交給競爭對手。正如他們所看到的那樣，他們擁有出色的產品；更強大，更靈活，更可靠，更便宜。如果“大石油”可以製造或購買太陽能電池板，並以比挖油要低的成本向客戶提供電力；多麼貪婪和虐待狂，您想畫它們，至少相信他們不會扔掉錢。許多大型能源公司被指控購買綠色能源概念並擠壓它們，再也看不到。兩家公司希望儘早參加下一件大事，但是他們發現的是一種劣等產品，在沒有政府乾預的情況下就不會自行站立。他們保留了技術，但繼續銷售市場想要的東西：最便宜的解決方案。現在就是石油。能源公司已經投資了“綠色能源”，現在正在這樣做。但是，獲得綠色能源的必要資本太多，而從中獲得的利潤率太小。目前嘗試綠色能源的主要原因是政府強迫它以及這些公司收到的宣傳。這並不是說，綠色能源成為一種更加有利可圖的投資將有一個時間點。結論：您總是會聽到人們稱能源公司的邪惡。但是，當人們抱怨公司應該放棄化石燃料時，有必要牢記，由於能源公司必須支付的額外費用，您將為它支付額外費用。
How did translations of the first languages go about?,"Do you mean how do peoples who speak different languages learn each other's language? This can be done in much in the same way as the fundamentals of language are taught: lots of ad hoc sign language. You could start with the basics such as ""My name is X. What is your name?"" and progress to pointing at objects and giving their names. The grammatical rules can be picked up by noticing how words are ordered and how they change in various contexts, such as when referring to one object or many . EDIT: grammar",第一種語言的翻譯是如何進行的？,您是說會說不同語言的人們如何學習彼此的語言？這可以以與教授語言的基礎知識相同的方式完成：許多臨時手語。您可以從諸如“我的名字X”之類的基礎知識開始。你叫什麼名字？”並進步指向對象並給出他們的名字。語法規則可以通過注意到單詞的排序方式以及它們在各種情況下的變化（例如指參考一個對像或許多對象）的變化來挑選。編輯：語法
Why are some medications race-based?,"There's sufficient genetic difference between various human races to create different reactions to certain drugs, or increase the possibility of certain reactions in certain races. An example of one such difference is a genetic switch in some Asians that floors them completely when they have one drink because their metabolism very rapidly turns the alcohol they ingest into acetaldehyde, which is poisonous when in larger doses and gives them wicked hangovers. Some drugs are metabolized or take effect in different ways as programmed by race-specific genetics, and that can lead to bad side-effects such as cancer or a drug that just doesn't work at all.Well, in addition to the genes that cause skin color, people of different races tend to share lots of other genes. For example, a particular form of heart failure is very prominent among blacks compared with whites . As such, a drug was approved to deal with this specific problem that tends to disproportionately effect black people. Race based medicine is a controversial subset of personalized medicine. The whole idea of personalized medicine is tailoring treatments to your own personal body, genes, and conditions. Since racial groups have very similar genetics compared with people outside that group, race-based medicine can be a stepping stone towards personalized medicineI wouldn't call Medication ""Race Based"". Much of the efficacy of medicine has to do with the condition you are being treated for. Certain subsets of the population are more likely than others to have certain diseases and genetic abnormalities which can make medicine either more effective or less effective. This provides the appearence of a ""Race"" or ""Genetic"" Based"" distribution of medicine despite not being such.",為什麼一些藥物是基於競賽的藥物？,各種人類種族之間存在足夠的遺傳差異，可以對某些藥物產生不同的反應，或增加某些種族中某些反應的可能性。一個這樣的差異的一個例子是一些亞洲人的遺傳轉換，當他們喝一杯時，它們將它們完全浮動，因為它們的新陳代謝非常迅速地將他們攝入的酒精轉化為乙醛，當以較大劑量的情況下，它們是有毒的，並給他們帶來了邪惡的宿醉。某些藥物是由種族特異性遺傳學編程的不同方式代謝或以不同的方式生效的，這可能導致副作用不良，例如癌症或根本不起作用的藥物。導致膚色，不同種族的人傾向於共享許多其他基因。例如，與白人相比，黑人中特定的心力衰竭形式非常突出。因此，批准了一種藥物來處理這個特定問題，這種特定問題往往會影響黑人。基於種族的藥物是個性化醫學的一個有爭議的子集。個性化醫學的整個想法是為自己的個人身體，基因和疾病量身定制治療方法。由於與該群體以外的人相比，種族群體具有非常相似的遺傳學，因此基於種族的藥物可能是對個性化醫藥的墊腳石，不會將藥物稱為“基於種族”。醫學的大部分功效與您所治療的狀況有關。某些人群的某些子集比其他人群更有可能患有某些疾病和遺傳異常，這可以使醫學更有效或有效。這提供了基於“種族”或“遺傳”的醫學分佈的外觀。
How does Publix (a grocery chain in the SE United States) make a profit when they offer so many buy one-get one (BOGO) deals?,"The store doesn't fund those sales - the manufacturer does. The manufacturer then uses this marketing expense as a tax write-off. Source: used to work in the industry.There's no single reason. Sometimes the profit margin really is so high, they can do that and still make a profit. This is particularly true of junk food. In the case of fresh food, it might be an overstock - use it or lose it. It might even be a ""loss leader"": sell a few items at a loss to get feet in the store.well, think of it like this. you need ice cream. you see a publix ad for bogo ice cream pints. so you go to publix to get ice cream. then you also get bread, milk and a candy bar while you're there. they just made some more $ because you saw the ad. maybe the ice cream is nearing the sell by date. if they don't unload them, they'll have to toss or return them. so easier to make some $ quickly by doing a bogo. and just because it's bogo doesn't mean they don't make profit. say the store buys the pint for $1 each. they still individually for $4. so if they say bogo free, they're still making profit. just maybe not as much as they would've.",當Publix（美國東南部的雜貨連鎖店）如何提供這麼多的單一購買（Bogo）交易時，他們如何獲利？,該商店無法為這些銷售提供資金 - 製造商確實可以。然後，製造商將這筆營銷費用用作稅收減免。資料來源：曾經在該行業工作。沒有一個原因。有時，利潤率確實很高，他們可以做到這一點，但仍然可以獲利。垃圾食品尤其如此。就新鮮食物而言，它可能是積積 - 使用或丟失。它甚至可能是“損失領導者”：賣掉一些物品以損失為腳步，以便在商店裡腳步。您需要冰淇淋。您會看到Bogo冰淇淋品脫的Publix廣告。因此，您去Publix買冰淇淋。然後，您在那裡時還會得到麵包，牛奶和糖果吧。他們只是做了一些$，因為您看到了廣告。也許冰淇淋按日期賣出了。如果他們不卸載它們，則必須折騰或退還它們。因此，通過做bogo快速賺一些$。而僅僅因為Bogo並不意味著他們沒有獲利。說商店以每份1美元的價格購買品脫。他們仍然以4美元的價格單獨。因此，如果他們說免費的Bogo，他們仍在獲利。也許不像他們那樣多。
Why do many large companies lease their office/retail space instead of owning it?,"There are a couple of reasons I can think of.1. A lease is nearly a 100% write off as it is an expense. If a company gets a loan on the building only the interest would be a write off. 2. Buying a building with cash locks in a lot of capital to a single asset. Capital that could be used for other ways of increasing productivity. 3. Selling a building can be a long drawn out process depending on the market. So if a business decided to move they would have a difficult time scheduling that when compared to a lease where they know when the lease is up and can plan accordinglyIt would be my guess that they want to limit their risk in the real estate market as well as leave themselves an opportunity to move elsewhere rather easily if the market or business needs change. For example, a building a company is renting could be in a high traffic area and attract a lot of customers/employees for the first several years of operation but what if competition opens up nearby and they see a BIG drop in their revenue; moving elsewhere could remedy the issue. Also, their businesses could expand and profits could increase so exponentially that they would need to move to a bigger building to accommodate more staff and updates.",為什麼許多大型公司租賃其辦公室/零售空間而不是擁有它？,我能想到的有兩個原因。1。租約幾乎是100％的註銷，因為這是一筆費用。如果公司在建築物上獲得貸款，只有利息將是註銷。2.購買一棟擁有現金鎖的建築物，其中大量資本為單個資產。可用於提高生產率的其他方式的資本。3.銷售建築物可能是長期以來的流程，具體取決於市場。因此，如果一家企業決定搬家因為如果市場或企業需要變化，就可以讓自己很容易移動其他地方。例如，一家公司正在租用的建築物可能位於高流量區，並在運營的頭幾年吸引了許多客戶/員工，但是如果競爭在附近開放，他們的收入大幅下降呢？搬到其他地方可以解決這個問題。此外，他們的業務可以擴大，利潤可能會呈指數增長，以至於他們需要搬到更大的建築物以適應更多的員工和更新。

How can people function on only a few hours of sleep?,"Polyphasic sleep is supposedly one way - I tried it a couple of times, but I suck at sleeping during the day, so it never worked out for me. Check out the various patterns at the Wikipedia page: _URL_0_ I would LOVE to get the Uberman pattern going, if it actually works - look at the remark about the Dymaxion pattern, the author couldn't actually test it because his wife wouldn't let him. As for myself, I don't sleep that much, typically between 5 and 6 hours a day. It seems to work out fine, I found that it actually helps avoiding caffeine. It may give you a boost, but long-term, it brings you down. I go several days without drinking any soda at all. If you currently have a habit, you need to shake it - that means zero caffeine for at least 7 days . One or twice a week, I typically crash and have to sleep for a few hours during the day, usually on a weekend. It should also be mentioned that most sleep experts agree that cutting down the amount of sleep per day has a negative impact on your health.As the short-tempered, sleep-deprived parent of a new 10-week-old, I am honestly not sure it is possible to function on only a few hours sleepYou can train yourself to live with little sleep, but long-term, it affects the brain as if you are constantly drunk. You can still do simple tasks, but you will also take much longer for them, care a lot less about consequences if you do something wrong and thus the extra time you gain through sleeping less is more than compensated by the low quality of your work in the time you are awake.I think it's very important to have a strong focus in life. That when you wake up you know exactly what to do. I'm the opposite of that, so sleep is very important to me.",人們只能在幾個小時的睡眠中運作？,據推測，多重的睡眠是一種方式 - 我嘗試了幾次，但是我白天睡著了，所以對我來說從來沒有解決過。在Wikipedia頁面上查看各種模式：_url_0_我很想讓Uberman模式進行，如果它實際上有效 - 看一下有關dymaxion模式的評論，作者實際上無法對其進行測試，因為他的妻子不讓他的妻子不讓他。至於我自己，我睡不多，通常每天5至6個小時。它似乎可以奏效，我發現它實際上有助於避免咖啡因。它可能會給您帶來改善，但長期的增強，它會使您失望。我幾天沒有喝蘇打水。如果您目前有習慣，則需要搖動它 - 這意味著至少7天零咖啡因。每週一次或兩次，我通常會崩潰，白天通常在一個週末睡幾個小時。還應該提到的是，大多數睡眠專家都同意，減少每天的睡眠量會對您的健康產生負面影響。由於脾氣暴躁，睡眠不足的父母是一個新的10周大的父母，老實說我不是當然，只能在幾個小時內工作，您可以訓練自己幾乎沒有睡眠，但長期會影響大腦，就好像您經常喝醉了一樣。您仍然可以執行簡單的任務，但是您還將花費更長的時間，如果您做錯了什麼，那麼對後果的關心要少得多，因此您通過睡眠減少的額外時間遠遠超過了您的工作質量低下的補償。您醒著的時間。我認為在生活中重點很重要。當您醒來時，您會確切知道該怎麼做。我與之相反，所以睡眠對我非常重要。
How did calendars developed thousands of years ago such as the Julian calendar keep track of time so efficiently?,"Actually, they didn't get it quite right, to the point where they had to eliminate about 10 days in the fall, about 500 years ago, to correct the accumulating error.

What do physicists mean when they say space is curved?,"Because spacetime behaves like it's curved by the presence of mass and energy. What does curvature mean? Let's say we have two points and we draw a straight line between them. Now let's say we want to increase the length of the line while keeping the endpoints fixed. How do we do that? We curve it so that it's no longer straight. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so to increase the distance, we make the line no longer straight. If you have two points in empty space, there is some distance between them. Now put the same two points near a black hole, and you'll measure the distance between the points to be larger. The way physicists interpret this is that the space in between the two points near the black hole is curved . > Why would an empty space have any shape at all either flat or curved? A completely empty universe would just have the Minkowski metric of Special Relativity, which is globally flat.",物理學家說空間彎曲時意味著什麼？,因為時空的行為就像是由於質量和能量的存在所彎曲的。曲率是什麼意思？假設我們有兩個點，我們在它們之間劃清界線。現在，假設我們希望在保持端點固定的同時增加線的長度。我們該怎麼做？我們彎曲它，以使其不再是筆直的。兩個點之間的最短距離是一條直線，因此為了增加距離，我們使線路不再是直線。如果您在空白空間中有兩個點，則它們之間有一定距離。現在，將相同的兩個點放在黑洞附近，您將測量點之間的距離更大。物理學家的解釋方式是，黑洞附近兩個點之間的空間彎曲。>為什麼一個空白空間完全具有平坦或彎曲的形狀？一個完全空的宇宙只會擁有特殊相對論的Minkowski度量，該度量在全球範圍內。
Why did a law need to be passed telling federal employees that they couldn't participate in insider trading?,"This is how I understand it. Can someone please fill in the details or correct me on this? Part of the reason is because, technically, a lot of what they were doing wasn't ""insider"" trading. Typically, insider trading happens when you work for a company or are someway involved in a company and you happen to know that your company did something good, so you and your buddies buy up a bunch of stock in advance of that public knowledge. There are other ways, but basically it's when you or someone you know has knowledge ""inside"" of a company. There's plenty of that that went on in Congress as well, and still will. But what was happening was that Congress itself was the ""insider"". It knew it was about to pass a law that, say, hurt companies X, Y, and Z. So they took that knowledge and sold their shares or ""shorted"" them to make a profit off this knowledge. Technically, this didn't have anything to do with having ""inside knowledge"" of a company's performance, financials, etc, so it was legal. It's still wrong, though, because it gives lawmakers a financial incentive to make laws one way or another that benefit them financially.",為什麼需要通過一項法律告訴聯邦僱員無法參加內幕交易？,這就是我的理解。有人可以填寫詳細信息還是在此上糾正我？部分原因是因為從技術上講，他們所做的很多事情都不是“內部”交易。通常，當您在公司工作或某種程度上參與公司時，內幕交易會發生，並且您碰巧知道您的公司做得很好，因此您和您的好友在公眾知識之前就購買了一堆股票。還有其他方法，但基本上是您或您認識的某人在公司內部知識的時候。國會也有很多事情發生，但仍然會。但是發生的事情是國會本身就是“內部人士”。它知道它將通過一項法律，例如傷害公司X，Y和Z。因此，他們掌握了這些知識並出售了自己的股份或“短暫”他們以獲利這些知識。從技術上講，這與擁有公司業績，財務等的“內部知識”無關，因此這是合法的。不過，這仍然是錯誤的，因為它給立法者提供了一種經濟動力，以一種或另一種方式使他們在經濟上受益。

This means that when you wake up at 2:30 in the morning because you heard a bump downstairs, or a loud howl of wind, your mind goes into overdrive because the 'threat' could be quite a lot closer due to your unconscious state.

"What is actually going on inside your body when you ""get the wind knocked out of you""?","Your solar plexus is a bundle of nerves.

This keeps you from breathingAfter being ""winded"" many times, I 've developed a method to recover quickly. Now this might be an actual thing that is well known about. And feel free to call me out on this. But what I do is, I put all the effort I can into exhaling. I reasoned that while it is hard to breath normally when you have the wind knocked out of you. Exhaling is easier than breathing in. And other than being quite terrifying, once you breath out. You automatically breath in.

Even when you exhale as much as possible, you will not be able to remove this residual volume from your lungs. A strong enough force to your diaphragm however, could actually push some of that residual volume out, which can be very painful and can cause the alveoli to collapse.

What if any economic impact will the Large Hadron Collider have on mankind?,"It's impossible to know, but you might be surprised. Some quick examples: 1. The Internet as we know it today was the result of the work of Tim Berners-Lee, an employee of CERN, the operator of the LHC. He coupled the Internet, the largest node of which was then at CERN, with the concept of HyperText . CERN was later the host of the world's first modern website. 2. Abstract concepts to us, like relativity, have surprising uses. As it happens, relativity is crucial to the operation of GPS, which wouldn't be accurately able to locate a device on Earth using timing signals from space without it. 3. Technology driven for one purpose can often be redirected for another. By building the LHC we 've had to solve some incredibly challenging problems, the first to spring to mind being that it produces about a petabyte of data per second, which needs to be assessed and stored in real-time. That's a pants-on-head stupid amount of data, and I can't think of any such challenge that we 've ever had to overcome before, and it's an interesting way of foreseeing some of the challenges we're almost certainly going to face with the growth of the Internet.",如果大型強子對撞機對人類有任何經濟影響，該怎麼辦？,這是不可能知道的，但是您可能會感到驚訝。一些快速的例子：1。我們今天所知道的互聯網是LHC運營商Cern的僱員Tim Berners-Lee的作品的結果。他將互聯網結合在一起，當時的互聯網是Cern的最大節點，以及超文本的概念。Cern後來成為世界上第一個現代網站的主持人。2.對我們的抽象概念，例如相對論，具有令人驚訝的用途。碰巧的是，相對論對於GP的運行至關重要，GPS無法準確地使用來自空間的時序信號在地球上找到一個設備。3.一個目的驅動的技術通常可以重定向到另一個目的。通過構建LHC，我們必須解決一些令人難以置信的具有挑戰性的問題，這是第一個到春天的問題是，它會每秒產生數據的數據，需要實時評估和存儲。那是一件愚蠢的數據，我想不出我們以前必須克服的任何挑戰，這是一種預見我們幾乎可以肯定會遇到的一些挑戰的有趣方法面對互聯網的增長。

Why is it so hard for smokers to stop smoking?,"There is a lot of ritual involved in smoking and a lot of nostolgia for most people that goes beyond the physical addiction. Many people have their work tied in mentally to cigarette breaks. The stress is the stress of that ritual being disrupted. For a smoker the smoke break is like waiting for Christmas and Christmas comes every two hours. Take that away and it becomes hard to tolerate previously tolerable things. There is also a sort of fraternity among smokers that you loose. Many people met lots of friend over bumming, giving away cigarettes to others. Smoke breakers usually move in crowds, whether in work or in bars and it is a social network that can get you laid or advance your career Smoking is like a little present you get every day with all sorts of great memories and people attached to it.

Why are death row inmates housed separately?,"People care less about obeying rules when they are about to die. At this point what do they have to lose? Did Jerry over in cell D12 make a rude comment about your mother? Maybe Jerry should get stabbed 12 times with a sharpened tooth brush. What are the guards going to do about it? Kill you? lol!It is custom. There also might be the fear that an inmate with literally nothing to lose would kill another over the slightest thing. I was told that an inmate on death row believes if he kills an officer he will be tried for it which would start the whole process over for him and buy him more time. This is not true. But all that matters is that the inmate believes it. One small part of the reason is that working on death row is voluntary. An officer may believe that confinement is the only way to deal with the behavior of individuals. But they may not believe that once an person is confined and cannot harm others then he should also be killedThey tend to be pretty bad people, and they have nothing to lose. Most inmates can look forward to being released someday, until they manage to commit crimes while in prison. Even those with life sentences have a future to think about, and bad behavior can make that future much worse. Those on death row can act with impunity because they have no future, and any punishment the state can mete out pale in comparison to death.

Why do we capitalise all words except conjunctions and some prepositions in titles?,"Convention, at heart. It used to be that writers capitalized all letters. Then, some time passed, and they capitalized only nouns and beginnings of sentences. Then, more time passed, and they started capitalizing only proper nouns. It's gotten to the point that we only capitalize more meaningful words in general and in titles. For instance, ""the"" isn't as meaningful as nouns and verbs are. EDIT: Teotwaki69 correctly says in the below post that the convention is based on parts of speech.It's just the convention, but there are variations and it hasn't always been the same. For example, some websites *Capitalize Every Word In A Headline*. On the other hand, the standard in British English is to only capitalize *The first word and any proper nouns, like Jones, in the headline.* "", 'BTW, in German, all nouns are capitalized, as well as the beginning of the sentence. But ""I"" is not. So i was going to the Farm to get some Eggs. In the US we usually capitalize everything having to do with the Deity. So the Lord said of Jesus, ""This is My Beloved. Hear ye Him."" AFAIK, the is not true internationally, for example in Canada, Australia, or Great BritainI believe it just helps to give the important words more significance to make certain things quicker and easier to read. Even if you don't fully read the words ""for"" and ""and"", your brain would still naturally assume that they are there in between the important words whilst quickly reading a sentence.",為什麼我們將所有單詞都大寫，除了連詞和標題中的一些介詞？,慣例，內心。曾經是作家大寫了所有字母。然後，一段時間過去了，他們僅利用名詞和句子的開始。然後，更多的時間過去了，他們開始僅大寫專有名詞。到了，我們只利用更有意義的詞，總體上和標題中都有資本。例如，“ the”並不像名詞和動詞那樣有意義。編輯：teotwaki69在以下文章中正確地說，公約是基於演講的部分。這只是約定，但是有變化，而且並不總是一樣。例如，某些網站 *將標題中的每個單詞都大寫 *。另一方面，英國英語的標準是僅大寫 *第一個單詞和任何專有名詞，例如瓊斯（Jones），標題。這句話。但是“我”不是。所以我要去農場去買一些雞蛋。在美國，我們通常利用與神有關的一切。所以主對耶穌說：“這是我的摯愛。聽到你的聲音。充分閱讀“ for”和“ and”的單詞，您的大腦仍然自然會假設它們在重要詞之間，同時迅速閱讀句子。
Why does toothpaste clean headlights so well?,"Toothpaste is an abrasive. If you imagine starting with a plank of rough wood, and wanted it to be really smooth, you'd start with really rough sandpaper. That would scrape out lots of deep grooves in the wood. You'd now have something with a rough finish, and would repeat that with finer and finer grades of sandpaper. Going from 40 up to 250 or higher would leave you with a smooth surface, and the scratches get finer, and each time you're scraping away the smaller scratches. For something see through it's harder, and the light gets bent more easily by even small scratches, so you'd have to use really really high grades of sandpaper, and it still might look foggy. Now instead of sandpaper, imagine you took the abrasive off the paper and just rubbed it straight on with a cloth. This would be polishing compound, and it makes much smaller scratches. If you use very small abrasive particles, the scratches are too small to be that far off a flat surface. Toothpaste is a close approximation to a polishing compound like this. The scratches are so small the surface is almost completely flat. You've removed the bigger scratches and your headlights are clear.",為什麼牙膏乾淨的大燈這麼好？,牙膏是一種磨料。如果您想像從一塊粗糙的木板開始，並希望它真的很光滑，那麼您將從真正粗糙的砂紙開始。那會刮掉木頭上的許多深凹槽。現在，您將擁有一些粗糙的飾面，並以砂紙等級更優質地重複這一點。從40到250或更高，將使您的表面光滑，並且划痕變得更細，每次刮擦較小的划痕時。要看一下它的困難，而且燈光甚至很容易彎曲，因此您必須使用真正高級的砂紙，而且看起來仍然可能有霧。現在，您可以想像一下您將磨料從紙上取出，然後用布直擦紙。這將是拋光化合物，並且會產生較小的划痕。如果使用非常小的磨料顆粒，則划痕太小，無法遠離平坦的表面。牙膏是像這樣的拋光化合物的近似值。划痕太小，表面幾乎完全平坦。您已經刪除了較大的划痕，並且大燈很清楚。
"in World War 2, to go home did you have to become disabled and would you get paid straight away?","There were a number of qualifications needed to be sent home from the front during World War II as a discharged serviceman or woman - 1.) Contracting an illness that required long term recovery2.) Amputations3.) Wounds that interfered with stamina, agility, dexterity4.) Loss of sight in at least one eye5.) Capture and Interrment in a POW camp There were other reasons, but those were the majority of the causes resulting in discharge from the military. Compensation came in the forms of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill of Rights. Under this Bill, servicemen who served in WWII were eligible to receive the following: - four years of education or training. At the time, this consisted of $500 towards tuition, books and supplies, plus a monthly subsistence allowance. - guaranteed home, farm and business loans up to $2,000 - unemployment benefits of $20 weekly for up to 52 weeks provided they served a minimum of 90 days prior to medical discharge. It was also understood that returning soldiers, if they were able, could resume their previous employment, vacated when they either enlisted or were drafted. [ Taken from: _URL_0_ ] As for disability payments? The answer is no. They were not paid straight away. Applications were reviewed and often delayed, temporary or in significantly smaller amounts than anticipated. To this day, there are WWII veterans who are still struggling to obtain disability compensation from their time in WWII. For some of these soldiers, their benefits were cut off, or were delayed, or otherwise ended precipitously. Case in point: _URL_3_ The veterans were able to receive some rehabilitative services, and some additional health care services thanks to the 1943 LaFollette-Barden Vocational Rehabilitation Act, and then later, thanks to 1946 Hill-Burton Act, where hospitals, rehab centers and public health facilities, but at the time, the 1935 Social Security Act's disability clauses applied primarily to the blind and disabled children. It wasn't until the 1950s that Social Security was expanded to include disability benefits.

"why do news channels consider Twitter a reliable, relevant, and serious source for different things?","Newspaper reporter here. Proof: _URL_0_ Journalists use Twitter as a place for information the same way we talk to people as sources. There are a lot of people on Twitter who do and say newsworthy things. Barack Obama, Pope Francis, tons of politicians, scientists and business people all have Twitter accounts. Sometimes they post things that are relevant to larger audiences. The other thing that's great about Twitter is when breaking news happens. During the Boston Marathon bombings manhunt, average citizens posted information about what streets police shut down and provided details about what they heard and saw from places journalists couldn't get to. The people on Twitter gave first-hand accounts that reporters used as leads to tell the rest of the country what was going on. Social media in general made a huge impact on the Arab Spring, which started in 2010 when citizens took to the streets in protest against various governments throughout the Middle East. Average people's tweets and videos became the first recordings of history. It was an incredible moment that showed how social media could make such a profound impact on the world at large. Good reporters take what they see on Twitter with a grain of salt just like we treat all information we receive with a bit of skepticism. Twitter is never used as the full story but it has become a major way people around the world share information. People in the media can't and shouldn't ignore it as a legitimate place to learn more about what is happening outside of our newsrooms.> Twitter was just for teens and young adults When reputable sources starting using it to disseminate information, that is no longer the case. Twitter is an easy way to reach a massive number of people, be it to share a major headline, or a photo of your dinner plate.Reliable, relevant, and serious news sources don't consider Twitter a reliable source for news.

Why are mice associated with cheese?,"Most mice prefer to feed on grains and nuts rather than cheese, but when they're hungry, they'll eat whatever they can find that is edible. Cheese tends to smell very strongly, especially when not refrigerated, and that makes it easier to find by mice, so when they're hungry, they'll go for whatever's easiest to find, i.e. cheese. Over time, this created the assumption that mice like cheese, and this in turn was used in cartoons and other media so often that some people assume that mice are inordinately fond of cheese.Cheese is often storded for long periods of time which increase the chance of mice finding it. Cheese has been made a long time so it has has time to fester as a symbol', ""Once upon a time, we didn't have refrigerators. We had bread boxes, cookie jars, etc. But cheese?

How do speakers of tonal languages convey different degrees of emotion?,"From experience .Before we start, let me try to explain a small bit about how the language works, since it's quite different from English. What most people call words in Mandarin, those single syllabic things with tones, apart from some very commonly used ones, are almost never used alone. They are almost used as part of a short ""phrase"", which work a lot more similarly to words in English. And because of this, those ""phrases"" are about as well known for a Mandarin speaker, as words are for an English speaker. So you have a lot more freedom regarding emphasis and tone than you would imagine. There are only 4 tones in Mandarin , flat, rising, falling then rising, and falling. These only apply to those single syllabic words and are quite distinct from each other, differentiating between them isn't too hard . A phrase as a whole may have a variety of ""tones"" itself, rising or falling within itself. If this is hard to imagine, picture a piece of music that has an overall rising melody, it may have small parts of it that rise or fall. And this combined with emphasis on words, stresses, etc can convey just as many nuances as English. And as far as someone breaking down in tears, that's pretty hard to understand in any language.",音調語言的說話者如何傳達不同程度的情感？,從經驗開始。在開始之前，讓我嘗試解釋一下語言的工作原理，因為它與英語完全不同。大多數人用普通話稱之為單詞，除了一些非常常用的音調外，那些帶有音調的單一音節事物幾乎從來都不是單獨使用的。它們幾乎被用作簡短的“短語”的一部分，它的作用與英語中的單詞更相似。因此，那些“短語”以普通話的說話而聞名，因為說英語的人。因此，您對重點和語調的自由度比您想像的要多。普通話中只有4個音調，平坦，上升，跌落然後跌落。這些僅適用於那些單一的音節單詞，並且彼此之間的區別很大，它們之間的區別並不難。整個短語可能具有各種“音調”本身，在自身內部上升或落在。如果這很難想像，請描繪出一段整體上升旋律的音樂，它可能有一小部分升起或下降。加上對單詞，壓力等的強調，可以傳達與英語一樣多的細微差別。就某人流淚而言，這很難用任何語言理解。
Why is self-plagiarism an issue in academics?,"SOURCE: I am a college professor and published academic. Several people have already said ""you're not doing the work"" to which OP is responding, ""I did the work earlier and isn't the point just to be competent anyway?"" Well, yes and no. The fact is, if you asked ten educators the purpose of education, you 'd probably get fifteen different answers. Teaching you about specific subjects is one purpose. Teaching you ""how to learn""--that is, how to approach new material in a self-beneficial way--is another. Yet another is economic: part of going to school is learning to deal with authority, to perform seemingly pointless tasks, and to jump through hoops . Giving you a diploma or a degree is one way of telling employers, ""this person can do assignments."" Setting aside the cynical explanation, though, and returning to the purely pedagogical one: there is value in repetition. If you learn to play a single song on the piano, you will get very good at that song, but you will never become a concert pianist. If you lift weights only one time, you will never get stronger. If you turn in the same paper two or three or four times, you have only ""done the work"" once, when the real educational value is to be found in ""doing the work"" over and over again. That's why it's generally disallowed by teachers and professors: because it's ""cheating"" yourself out of the experience the class is supposed to provide. That said, as a graduate student I have quoted my own previous work in new papers, complete with citation, and have never been criticized for it.In academic writing, the assumption is that uncited ideas are a new contribution to the field, even if it was your idea in the first place. It's just a report for a class, but they want you to get used to the style. ",為什麼自位態主義在學者中是一個問題？,資料來源：我是一名大學教授，並出版了學術。幾個人已經說過“您不在做工作”，而OP正在回應：“我早些時候做了工作，而不是要能有能力的重點嗎？”好吧，是的，否。事實是，如果您向十名教育工作者詢問教育的目的，那麼您可能會得到15個不同的答案。教您有關特定主題的目的是之一。教您“如何學習”  - 也就是說，如何以一種自給自足的方式處理新材料 - 是另一種。另一個是經濟：上學的一部分是學習處理權威，執行看似毫無意義的任務並跳過籃球。給您文憑或學位是告訴雇主的一種方式：“這個人可以做任務。”不過，請擱置憤世嫉俗的解釋，然後返回純粹的教學方法：重複有價值。如果您學會在鋼琴上播放一首歌，那麼您將非常擅長那首歌，但是您將永遠不會成為音樂會鋼琴演奏家。如果您只舉重一次，您將永遠不會變得更強壯。如果您兩次或四次或四次上交同一篇論文，則只能在“做工作”一遍又一遍地找到真正的教育價值時一次“完成工作”。這就是為什麼教師和教授通常不允許這樣做的原因：因為這是從班級應該提供的經驗中“作弊”。也就是說，作為一名研究生，我引用了自己以前在新論文中的作品，並帶有引用，並且從未受到批評。首先，這是您的想法。這只是一堂課的報告，但他們希望您習慣這種樣式。
How do football pools work,"In the simplest form, you have a 10x10 grid of squares. Along one axis, you have a team name & each column gets the numbers 0-9. Along the other you have the other team's name & the rows are labeled 0-9. When you buy into a pool, you buy a square and put your name in it. If your square wins, you get all the money. Each square represents a possible final score for the game, only looking at the final number. If a game is 24 to 14, the square at would be the ""winner""; if the game is 21 to 17, the winner would be .",足球池如何工作,以最簡單的形式，您有一個10x10的正方形。沿著一個軸，您有一個團隊名稱，每列獲得數字0-9。沿另一個，您有另一個團隊的名字，而行被標記為0-9。當您購買游泳池時，您會購買一個廣場並將其名字放入其中。如果您的廣場獲勝，您將獲得所有的錢。每個廣場代表遊戲的最終得分，只查看最終數字。如果一場比賽是24到14，則廣場將是“贏家”；如果比賽是21到17，那麼獲勝者將是。
How are things sticky?,"Adhesives and other sticky substances contain protein molecules that bond with the molecules of the surface they are spread upon by entering the pores and spaces of the material. Therefore, smooth surfaces such as glass are hard to attach to because there aren't any pores for molecules to enter.",事情怎麼粘？,粘合劑和其他粘性物質含有蛋白質分子，通過進入材料的孔和空間來與表面的分子結合。因此，由於沒有任何分子進入的毛孔，因此很難連接到玻璃等光滑的表面。

"What happens to people who are insomniacs, and why do they struggle so much to fall asleep?","For one thing, there might be an underlying medical condition going on -- imagine trying to sleep well with chronic pain that's always happening. Or if you have an anxiety problem. Those things don't go away when you're trying to sleep. People might also have poor sleep hygiene. This means keeping some good, consistent practices with your sleep the same way you would do with things like showering or brushing your teeth. Try to go to bed at the same time every day, and limit any activities in bed other than sleeping or having sex. If you spend a lot of time in bed watching TV or whatever, your brain learns to associate the space with things other than sleep. If your brain associates the space with only sleep, you'll be more likely to fall asleep well -- the same way you might start to feel hungry after walking past a restaurant, even if you weren't hungry before. Stuff like exercising and avoiding caffeine later in the day helps too.",失眠的人會怎樣，為什麼他們要這麼多入睡？,一方面，可能會有一種潛在的醫療狀況 - 想像一下，試圖在慢性疼痛中良好睡眠。或者如果您有焦慮問題。當您試圖入睡時，這些事情不會消失。人們的睡眠衛生可能也很差。這意味著與淋浴或刷牙等事情相同的方式保持良好，一致的練習。嘗試每天同時上床睡覺，並限制除睡覺或做愛以外的床上任何活動。如果您花很多時間在床上看電視或其他任何時間，那麼您的大腦就會學會將空間與睡眠以外的事物聯繫起來。如果您的大腦僅將空間與睡眠相關聯，那麼您就會更有可能覺得自己入睡 - 就像您以前不餓後走過餐廳後可能會開始感到飢餓。當天晚些時候鍛煉和避免咖啡因等東西也有幫助。
"If cigarettes contain things like arsenic, butane, cadmium, ammonia, and formaldehyde, how can people smoke then everyday for years without dying within the first few weeks?","There is no such thing as lethal or safe substances. There are only lethal and safe doses. Water can be toxic if you drink enough of it""The dose makes the poison"" - Paracelsus This is condensed from - ""All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.""', ""Because they are not at immediately toxic levels. Over time, however, they cause a great deal of damage to a person's health.If you subjected a sandwich to a detailed chemical examination, you would find traces of most of those things as well. Cigarette smoking is bad for you, no doubt, but producing a laundry list of scary chemicals is not the way to prove that. It is just a dishonest scare tactic.There are three kinds of poisons in cigarette smoke, those that cause damage and those that cause cancer, and those that cause heart disease. The body has defence mechanisms against poisons and damage, but constant exposure overwhelms them, resulting in chronic damage like COPD . The heart is damaged by small particles that are so small they pass to the bloodstream. This causes blocking of the arteries in the heart. Finally, carcinogens are attacked by the DNA of lung or other cells. Damage to DNA can destroy self-destruct mechanisms that prevent DNA-damaged cells from surviving and dividing. But the genes are in specific positions and the carcinogens are attacked by random parts of DNA, so it's random like Russian roulette. This is why there's no safe dose. Of course people who smoke less get fewer cancers, but this works only on population level. For an individual, if you smoke lightly and get cancer it's still your fault because of the smoking.",如果香煙含有諸如砷，丁烷，鎘，氨和甲醛之類的東西，那麼人們如何在頭幾週內每天吸煙多年來就能吸煙？,沒有致命或安全的物質。只有致命和安全的劑量。如果您喝足夠多的“劑量使毒藥”喝足夠的水可能是有毒的。它們不立即處於有毒水平。但是，隨著時間的流逝，它們會對一個人的健康造成很大的損害。如果您對三明治進行了詳細的化學檢查，那麼您也會發現大多數這些東西的痕跡。吸煙。毫無疑問，對您有害，但是生產一份可怕的化學物質清單並不是證明這一點的方法。這只是一種不誠實的恐慌策略。香煙中有三種毒藥，造成傷害的毒藥，以及造成造成的毒品癌症以及引起心髒病的癌症。身體具有防禦毒藥和損害的防禦機制，但持續的暴露使它們淹沒了，導致慢性損害COPD。心臟受到小顆粒的傷害，這些小顆粒是如此小，以至於傳遞給血液。導致心臟中動脈的阻塞。最後，致癌物受到肺或其他細胞的DNA攻擊。對DNA的損害會破壞防止DNA受損細胞存活和分裂的自我毀滅機制。但是這些基因處於特定位置，致癌物被DNA的隨機部分攻擊，因此它像俄羅斯輪盤一樣隨機。這就是為什麼沒有安全劑量的原因。當然，吸煙較少的人得到的癌症會減少，但這僅在人口水平上起作用。對於一個人來說，如果您輕輕吸煙並患上癌症，那仍然是您的錯。
How exactly radiation affect human body?,"Energetic neutrons, and gamma rays and x-rays , go blasting off and strike molecules in your cells. This has the effect of physically breaking them apart, a la the neutron, or breaking covalent bonds as the rays do. Enough of this can just kill your cell outright. But if you just get the occasional strike against a DNA molecule, now you have a physically broken piece of DNA. If it doesn't kill the cell, DNA has an interesting property in that it can reassemble itself. The problem is it doesn't always go back the right way. Often, this creates a cancerous cell and your body will identify and destroy it. Sometimes, your immune system can't ""see"" the cell as cancerous and it's accidentally allowed to run rampant. More radiation is used in chemotherapy to kill the cells in the same way they were made cancerous in the first place.",輻射到底如何影響人體？,能量中子以及伽馬射線和X射線，爆炸並在您的細胞中擊中分子。這具有物理上分開的效果，中子是中子，或者像射線一樣打破共價鍵。這足以使您的細胞完全殺死您的細胞。但是，如果您偶爾會對DNA分子進行罷工，那麼現在您的DNA損壞了。如果它不殺死細胞，DNA具有有趣的屬性，可以重新組裝自己。問題是它並不總是以正確的方式返回。通常，這會產生一個癌細胞，您的身體會識別並破壞它。有時，您的免疫系統無法“將”細胞“視”癌症，並且偶然地允許運行猖ramp。在化學療法中使用更多的輻射來殺死細胞，就像最初使其癌變的方式相同。
Why is flossing considered more important than brushing?,"I'm not a dentist, but from what I've been told by my dentist, flossing reduces bleeding gums more than brushing. Bleeding gums are actually quite a problem, aside from being gross, because they add stress to the heart. So bleeding gums can actually contribute negatively, and sometimes severely, to the health of your circulatory system. Since you can live without teeth, but not a heart, I think that's the big point. Less dramatic is that flossing does prevent cavities in places where cavities are more prone, like between teeth and in the very back. These places are cleaned less efficiently by a brush. Also I've heard flossing does positive things for the health of your gums which brushing can't do. I also have heard that what the other commenters have said about how everybody brushes but many people don't floss, so the dental industry makes flossing a bullet point, is true as well.",為什麼牙線比刷牙更重要？,我不是牙醫，但據我的牙醫告訴我，牙線比刷牙減少了流血的牙齦。除了粗暴之外，流血的牙齦實際上是一個問題，因為它們增加了心臟的壓力。因此，出血的牙齦實際上可能對循環系統的健康產生負面影響，有時甚至會嚴重貢獻。由於您可以沒有牙齒而不是心臟生活，所以我認為這是重要的一點。不太戲劇性的是，牙線確實可以防止腔體更容易容易出現的腔體，例如牙齒和背部之間。這些地方的清潔效率較低。另外，我聽說牙線對牙齦的健康做了積極的事情，而牙齦的健康無法做到。我還聽說過，其他評論者對每個人都刷過的話說過的話，但許多人不塗抹牙線，因此牙科行業將牙線變成彈頭也是如此。
- Why taking long showers or brushing your teeth with the faucet open waste water?,"The source of your clean water and the location where your wastewater ends up are rarely the same. Water treatment plants can recapture SOME wastewater, but the rest is lost, dumped into the sea or downstream for the very reason that we don't want sewage in our water supply. It depends greatly on where you live, but commonly fresh water comes from snow melt and rainfall replenishing natural or man-made aquifers, and not being drawn from a river.", - 為什麼要長時間淋浴或用水龍頭開放式廢水刷牙？,清潔水的來源和廢水最終的位置很少相同。水處理廠可以捕獲一些廢水，但其餘的丟失，傾倒在海中或下游，原因是我們不想在供水中污水。這在很大程度上取決於您的住所，但通常淡水來自雪融化和降雨補充自然或人造含水層，而不是從河中抽出。
How are KFC's 11 secret herbs and spices still a secret?,"It's not worth it. At this point, KFC could probably publish the exact recipe on the walls of their restaurants and it wouldn't make a difference. No one is going to create a chain restaurant to make the exact same thing that another chain restaurant does with no changes at all. If someone wanted to make money selling KFC fried chicken, it would be far easier and more cost efficient to just franchise a KFC.",肯德基的11種秘密草藥和香料仍然是一個秘密？,這不值得。在這一點上，肯德基可能可以在其餐廳的牆壁上發布確切的食譜，這不會有所作為。沒有人會創建一家連鎖餐廳，以使另一家連鎖餐廳完全沒有變化的事情做出完全相同的事情。如果有人想賺錢出售肯德基炸雞，那麼只有肯德基專營權就容易得多，更具成本效益。

What happens after someone escapes prision,"The person who escaped tends to spend most of the time trying to get further from the prison while the police try and find them and then put them back in.The escapee is going to be on foot for at least a while, and they're probably in their prison uniform. Usually, the escape is discovered pretty quickly, and it doesn't take long to track down the escapee using some dogs to track their scent, along with other clues like footprints. If the escapee gets out of the immediate area, the prison has all of their details including pictures of their face, tattoos, weight, height, etc. This gives local police a far better picture of the person they're looking for than what they'd have after a robbery, and it makes any appearance in public for the escapee really risky. Unless they have someone on the outside ready to pick them up and hide them, they usually stay on foot, sticking to rural areas and parks. Someone with connections can have things set up on the outside to get a means of escape as well as the documents, clothes and other items needed to blend back into society. El Chapo's second escape involved a tunnel over a mile long that started at a shower, which had no cameras aimed at it, to a half-constructed house. Setting up this escape took at least a year of work. There was even a motorcycle inside the tunnel so he could get to the other side long before the prison would notice he was missing.",有人逃到監獄後會發生什麼,逃脫的人傾向於大部分時間試圖在警察試圖找到他們然後放回監獄的同時，然後將其放回。可能穿著他們的監獄制服。通常，逃生很快就會發現，並且很快就需要使用一些狗來追踪逃生者來追踪它們的氣味，以及其他線索等線索。如果Escapee離開附近地區，監獄的所有詳細信息包括他們的臉部，紋身，體重，身高等的照片。這使當地警察比他們所尋找的人更好地描繪了他們的照片'd在搶劫之後，它為Escapee真正冒險而在公開場合露面。除非他們在外面準備好接他們並隱藏它們，否則他們通常會徒步前往農村地區和公園。有連接的人可以在外面設置東西，以獲得逃生的手段，以及融入社會所需的文件，衣服和其他物品。El Chapo的第二次逃生涉及一英里長的隧道，該隧道從沒有針對它的攝像機的淋浴間到達了半建的房屋。建立這個逃生至少需要一年的工作。隧道內部甚至還有一輛摩托車，所以他可以在監獄注意到他失踪之前就可以到達另一側。

Why can't I become the President of the United States (I was born in Canada)?,"The founders were nervous that a foreign power would attempt to control the country by getting one of their own elected president. Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers: > Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one querter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? Also, if we let, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger become president, and some Austrian rose to become a belligerent European dictator , there'd be concern that he wouldn't necessarily act in the best interests of the United States.Its the rules **US Constitution, Article II, Section 1** No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.",為什麼我不能成為美國總統（我出生於加拿大）？,創始人擔心外國權力會試圖通過獲得自己當選的總統之一來控制國家。漢密爾頓在《聯邦主義者的論文》中寫道：>沒有什麼比這比每個可行的障礙都應該反對集會，陰謀和腐敗了。自然而然，這些共和黨政府最致命的對手可能會從一個以上的質疑中採取其方法，但主要是由於外國大國願望在我們的理事會中獲得不當的上升。他們怎麼能比將自己的生物養成聯盟的主要法官更好地滿足這一目標？另外，如果我們讓阿諾德·施瓦辛格（Arnold Schwarzenegger）成為總統，而奧地利的一些人則成為好戰的歐洲獨裁者，那麼他不必擔心他不一定符合美國的最大利益。美國憲法，第二條，第1條**，除了自然出生的公民或美國公民，在採用本憲法時，任何人都不得有資格被總統辦公室。沒有人有資格符合該辦公室的資格，他們不得年滿35歲，並且已經14歲是美國境內的居民。

Does the shape of the Pentagon actually help the U.S. military?,"The design of it was to maximize office space while minimizing travel time on foot from one side to the other. The theory was for better reaction times and message delivery.The Primary feature of the Pentagon is that no two points in the building are more than 7 minutes apart on foot. When it was built this was a significant upgrade over a similar size office building which would be a fairly large skyscraper. With modern technology it really isn't that important.Yes. If it was a different shape, like a hexagon, everyone would think they were stupid for calling it a pentagon. People would think they were stupid and weak, and would take advantage of the USWhen the Pentagon was planned there where two possible sites avaiable, initialy a site next to Arlington Cemetery was chosen which was roughly pentagonal, so to maximize the avaiable floor space the building was planed as a pentagon, later do to concerns that the building would block the view of Washington from Arlington Cemetery the location was changed to the other possible location but to avoid having to replan everything the building stayed as a pentagon.",五角大樓的形狀實際上有助於美國軍方嗎？,它的設計是最大化辦公空間，同時將步行從一側到另一側的步行最小化。該理論是為了更好的反應時間和消息傳遞。五角大樓的主要特徵是，建築物中沒有兩個點相距7分鐘以上。建造時，這是對類似尺寸的辦公樓的重大升級，這將是一個相當大的摩天大樓。有了現代技術，它確實並不重要。如果它是一種不同的形狀，例如六角形，每個人都會認為他們稱其為五角大樓很愚蠢。人們會認為自己是愚蠢和虛弱的，當五角大樓計劃在那裡計劃兩個可能的地點時，就會利用我們的五角大樓，而選擇了阿靈頓公墓旁邊的一個地點，大約是五角大樓被計劃為五角大樓，後來擔心該建築物會從阿靈頓公墓遮擋華盛頓的景色，該位置已更改為另一個可能的位置，但要避免重新挖掘建築物作為五角大樓的所有物品。
"If I'm thinking in english, what were thoughts like before we developed language?","Here is a quote from Hellen Keller recalling what her thought processes were like before she was introduced to language. Sure, it's not *exactly* what you're looking for, but I think it provides some insight. [*The World I Live In* by Hellen Keller, Page 37] > Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired. I had neither will nor intellect. I was carried along to objects and acts by a certain blind natural impetus. I had a mind which caused me to feel anger, satisfaction, desire > When I wanted anything I liked,--ice-cream, for instance, of which I was very fond,--I had a delicious taste on my tongue , and in my hand I felt the turning of the freezer. I made the sign, and my mother knew I wanted ice-cream. I ""thought"" and desired in my fingers. Thought without language, at least from what can be gleaned from Hellen Keller's own observations, is made up of basic desires, habits, and emotions . Complex thoughts aren't really possible without a language to build ideas out of. So thoughts like you're having, even by just asking a question such as the one you posted are really only possible because you have a language that you can think with.when you say 'thinking', that is a big process, of which 'thinking in words' is a small part. kind of like confusing the commentator for the entire ball game.",如果我用英語思考，我們在發展語言之前的想法是什麼？,這是海倫·凱勒（Hellen Keller）的一句話，回憶起她被介紹給語言之前的思維過程的樣子。當然，這不是 *準確 *您要尋找的東西，但我認為它提供了一些見解。[*我生活在* Hellen Keller的世界，第37頁]>在我的老師來找我之前，我不知道我是。我生活在一個無世界的世界中。我不能希望能充分描述無意識但有意識的虛無時期。我不知道我知道aught，或者我生活，行動或渴望。我既沒有意志也沒有理智。我被某種盲目的自然動力帶到了物體和行動。我有一個讓我感到憤怒，滿足感，渴望的想法>當我想要任何我喜歡的東西時 - 例如，我非常喜歡冰淇淋， - 我的舌頭上有美味的味道，在我的手中，我感到冰箱的轉動。我做了標誌，母親知道我想要冰淇淋。我“想著”，在手指上想要。沒有語言的思想，至少從海倫·凱勒（Hellen Keller）自己的觀察中可以收集的東西是由基本的慾望，習慣和情感組成的。沒有一種語言來建立思想，就不可能進行複雜的想法。因此，像您一樣的想法，即使只是問一個問題，例如您發布的問題才是真正的可能性，因為您有一種可以思考的語言。當您說“思考”時，這是一個很大的過程，這是一個很大的過程“用語言思考”是一小部分。有點像在整個球遊戲中混淆評論員。
What is the Eastern philosophical concept of Wu?,"The short version is that it's the concept of everything being interconnected and interdependent. This, in turn, is supposed to help people be more aware of how their actions affect others, because other people's actions affect them as well. A similar concept is the ""butterfly effect"", where a tiny change leads to bigger and bigger consequences, often too big for the original actor to realize.",吳的東方哲學概念是什麼？,簡短的版本是，這是一切相互聯繫和相互依存的概念。反過來，這應該幫助人們更加了解自己的行為如何影響他人，因為其他人的行為也影響了他們。一個類似的概念是“蝴蝶效應”，其中很小的變化會導致越來越大的後果，通常太大了，對於原始演員而言，無法實現。
How are instincts inherited to the following generation and is it possible to modificate and/ or create them?,"As far as I know, no one truly understands how instincts work. It is one thing to have a reflex, but there are complex behaviors are much tougher to explain. There was a recent neuroscience paper that came out that may help. Basically, they fear conditioned some male animals to a certain smell . They then had these males sire offspring. The offspring learned to be afraid of the smell much quicker than would normally be the case. They examined their olfactory system, and found that these offspring had increased receptors that were specific to the smell their Dad's had been made afraid of. Basically, making the Dad's afraid of a smell resulted in their offspring being particularly sensitive to that smell. This is called epigenetics: when experiences result in altered gene expression. Therefore, it is indeed possible, in a sense, for a ""memory"" to be passed on, although it isn't the memory per se, it is altered gene expressionInstincts are hard-wired into the brain and are genetically inherited. Think of genes that encode for proteins that wire the brain during development. The way nerve cells are wired with each other defines the behavior . The more complex the brain of the animal, the less of a role do instincts play.",如何將本能遺傳到下一代，是否可以修改和/或創建它們？,據我所知，沒有人真正了解直覺的工作方式。有反射是一回事，但是複雜的行為很難解釋。最近有一份神經科學論文可能會有所幫助。基本上，他們擔心有些雄性動物會聞到某種氣味。然後，他們讓這些雄性父親後代。後代學會了害怕的氣味要比通常情況要快得多。他們檢查了嗅覺系統，發現這些後代的受體增加了，這些受體特有的味道是他們父親害怕的氣味。基本上，使父親害怕的氣味導致他們的後代對這種氣味特別敏感。這稱為表觀遺傳學：當經驗導致基因表達改變時。因此，從某種意義上說，確實有可能傳遞“記憶”，儘管它不是記憶本身，但它被改變基因表達，將其硬連接到大腦中，並且是遺傳遺傳的。想想編碼發育過程中大腦的蛋白質的基因。神經細胞彼此連接的方式定義了行為。動物的大腦越複雜，本能扮演的角色就越少。
Why was 911 selected as the number to dial in case of emergency?,"They wanted a short, easy to remember number, but also one that was not as likely to be accidentally dialed. It also needed to be fast to dial during the era of rotary phones when the system was first designed. So a 3 digit number starting with 9 and then using the fastest to dial numbers of 1 was chosen.",為什麼在緊急情況下選擇911作為撥號的數字？,他們想要一個簡短，易於記住的數字，但也沒有意外撥號的數字。在系統首次設計時，在旋轉手機時代，也需要快速撥打。因此，從9開始，然後選擇最快到1的撥號編號。
How do selective hiring companies not get sued?,"Because their business model is built around having females. It's like how Hooters can hire only attractive women because they're technically hiring models who just happen to waitress, and being attractive is a job qualification for being a model.

"How do they manage to find precise recordings to make those composite/mash-up videos, of hundreds of clips of a person speaking certain words, to make them sing a song, etc?",I've actually also wondered the same thing and I think I have an answer. I don't know this for certain but I imagine that what the people do is find several speeches by the figure they are using and then find the transcripts of the speeches. This is not normally very difficult particularly for public figures such as the president. They then just need to ctrl-f the speech to find the words they want and then go to that location of the video. They can then cut that part of the video out and rinse and repeat. It's still time-consuming but it's much faster than just blindly watching hundreds of videos.,他們如何設法找到精確的錄音來製作那些複合/混搭視頻，這些視頻是數百個人講某些單詞的剪輯，使他們唱歌等？,實際上，我也想知道同樣的事情，我認為我有答案。我不確定這一點，但我想，人們所做的就是通過他們使用的數字找到幾個演講，然後找到演講的成績單。通常對於總統等公眾人物來說，這通常不是很困難。然後，他們只需要ctrl-f即可找到他們想要的單詞，然後轉到視頻的那個位置。然後，他們可以將視頻的那部分切開，然後沖洗並重複。它仍然很耗時，但比盲目觀看數百個視頻要快得多。

Why can blank CD's hold the same length of music at different bitrates?,"> why can a CD that can hold 80 minutes of 320 kbps not otherwise hold 200 minutes of 128 kbps? Because CD audio doesn't have a bitrate the way MP3s do. It's raw, uncompressed audio . So both the 128 kbps mp3 and the 320 kbps mp3 will be uncompressed and converted to wav format before being written to the CD, at which point their equivalent bitrates are the same.If you record a CD as an audio CD, it *always* writes the music as 44.1kHz, 16-bit **uncompressed** audio. If the source was a low-quality MP3, you just end up with low-quality audio recorded at 44.1kHz, 16-bit. If you write it as a *data* CD, you can fit different amounts of audio on there. Many modern CD players can handle MP3s.",為什麼Blank CD可以在不同的比特率上保持相同的音樂長度？,>為什麼可以容納80分鐘的320 Kbps的CD不能容納200分鐘的128 kbps？因為CD音頻沒有MP3的比特率。它是原始的，未壓縮的音頻。因此，在寫入CD之前，128 kbps mp3和320 kbps mp3都會被未壓縮並轉換為wav格式，這時它們的等效比特率是相同的。如果您將CD記錄為音頻CD，則 *始終 *始終 * *將音樂寫為44.1khz，16位**未壓縮**音頻。如果源是低質量的MP3，則最終以16位的44.1kHz錄製的低質量音頻。如果將其寫為 *數據 * CD，則可以在其中擬合不同數量的音頻。許多現代CD播放器可以處理MP3。
Why is the presence of complex organic molecules discovered on Comet 67P and other objects not enough evidence to definitively say that life exists beyond Earth?,"Complex organic molecules can form and exist without life. By complex, we are talking simple amino acids, nitrogenous bases, super-simple polycarbons. These are not the same as the long polymers you would get from carbon-based life.Complex organic molecules are a precursor to life, but not life in themselves.

"In video editing, what's the difference between Drop-Frame timecode, and Non-Drop-Frame timecode?","In non-drop-frame, there are exactly 30 frames in every second of footage, i.e., the timecode endings for every second go :00, :01, :02, :29. You should only use non-drop-frame timecodes if your footage is 30.000 frames per second. In drop-frame, the first second of every minute not divisible by ten misses the first two frames, i.e., 54 seconds every hour have only 28 timecode endings like ;02, ;03, ;04, ;29 Thus 108 timecodes are missing per hour. Otherwise there would be 108,000 timecodes per hour so the drop-frame system removes exactly 1 in 1000 timecodes. Note that no frames are dropped, just that some timecodes are missing so that frame 00;01;59;29 is followed by frame 00;02;00;02. Semicolons are used instead of colons to highlight what's going on. This is done because NTSC has only about 29.97 frames per second. In fact NTSC is exactly 1 part in 1001 short of 30 frames per second so the drop-frame notation, using 1 part in 1000, is not exactly right, but it's close enough.",在視頻編輯中，Drop-Frame時間代碼和非丟棄框架時間代碼之間有什麼區別？,"在非繪製框架中，每一秒鐘都有30幀，即，每秒的時代結尾：00，：01，：02，：29。如果您的錄像為每秒30.000幀，則應僅使用非磁盤時間編碼。在Drop-Frame中，每分鐘的第一秒不被十分排除在前兩個框架，即每小時54秒只有28個時間碼結尾，例如; 02，; 03，; 04，; 04，; 29因此，108個時間代碼丟失了108個時間代碼小時。否則，每小時將有108,000個時間編碼，因此Drop-Frame系統將完全刪除1000個時間編碼中的1個。請注意，沒有掉落的幀，只是缺少某些時間代碼，因此框架00; 01; 59; 29之後是框架00; 02; 00; 02。用半隆而不是結腸來突出發生了什麼。之所以這樣做，是因為NTSC每秒只有大約29.97幀。實際上，NTSC在每秒30幀的縮短1001幀中正好是1個部分，因此使用1000中使用1個零件的滴框表示法是不完全正確的，但它足夠接近。"
"Why is there is demand for high frames per second in video games, but it's ok for movies to stick to 24 fps? Is there a visible difference between the two mediums?","Movie motion isn't designed to feel completely real, it has a bigger than life dreamlike feel that comes from the motion blur that occurs at 24 frames per second. Most games on the other hand are trying to be immersive and give you the feeling of being there and that requires the motion to be smoother. While not a direct game to movie comparison, watch a movie and then watch a soap opera or a late night talk show. You can clearly see and feel a difference and that is because the movie with its dreamy 24fps and the soap or talk show which is running at a more natural 30fps.",為什麼在視頻遊戲中需要每秒高幀的需求，但是電影可以堅持24 fps？兩種介質之間有明顯的區別嗎？,電影動作並非旨在完全真實，它具有比生活般的夢幻般的感覺，它來自於每秒24幀的動作模糊帶來的。另一方面，大多數遊戲都試圖成為沈浸式的遊戲，並給您在那裡的感覺，這需要動作更加順暢。雖然不是電影比較的直接遊戲，但請觀看電影，然後觀看肥皂劇或深夜脫口秀節目。您可以清楚地看到並感到有所不同，這是因為這部電影具有夢幻般的24fps和肥皂或脫口秀節目，它以更自然的30fps運行。
How fast are things moving in the human body?,"it varies depending on what part of ""everything"" you're talking about. The main things, though, are the impulses fired from the brain down through the nervous system, which take some fraction of a millisecond, and the time it takes for your muscles to move your hand, which depends on the strength of your muscles, mass of your arm, and a few other factors. Most of the rest of your body isn't really involved beyond what's already going on; blood is pumping through your arm at what is probably a very-slightly-higher-than-resting rate due to the light activity, but it was pumping through there anyway, it just sped up a tiny bit since you weren't at a rest anymore. The muscles in your legs likely don't move at all, nor the muscles in your abs. Your digestive tract will continue digesting whatever's in there at its normal rate under most circumstances, unless your fingernails cause you to panic and have an adrenal response that temporarily slows/stops digestion and potentially voids your bowels.",事物在人體中運動的速度有多快？,它取決於您在談論的“一切”的哪一部分。不過，主要的事情是從大腦向下通過神經系統發射的衝動，這會花費一小部分毫秒，以及肌肉移動手所花費的時間，這取決於肌肉的力量，質量您的手臂和其他一些因素。您的身體其他大部分都沒有超出已經發生的事情。由於輕型活動，鮮血正在以比較高的速度響起，但無論如何它都在泵送，因為您沒有休息，所以它加快了一點點再過了。腿上的肌肉可能根本不會運動，也可能沒有肌肉的肌肉。在大多數情況下，您的消化道將繼續以正常速度消化，除非您的指甲會使您感到恐慌並具有腎上腺反應，從而暫時減慢/停止消化並潛在地使您的腸子失效。
Can ship execute swift maneuvers in space if it has a lot of power? Or will it always move slowly?,"More power can easily translate to faster maneuverability. Modern spaceships use small thrusters placed around the exterior of the ship to turn. When a thruster is facing anywhere other than directly towards or away from the center of mass, activating it will change the direction that the object is facing. You might compare this to a tugboat maneuvering a large cargo shop into a dock. The tugboat will push on say the back left of the shop turning the front left. Now if you replaced the tugboat with an aircraft carrier, the cargo ship is going to move faster when it hits. So yes more powerful manuvering thrusters will speed up your turning and execution speed.",如果船具有很大的力量，可以在太空中執行執行操作嗎？還是它總是會慢慢移動？,更多的功率可以輕鬆地轉化為更快的可操作性。現代太空飛船使用船外部周圍放置的小型推進器進行轉彎。當推進器直接朝向質量中心以外的任何地方時，激活它將改變對象面向的方向。您可以將其與將大型貨物店拖到碼頭的拖船進行比較。拖船會推動商店的左後方轉動左前。現在，如果您用航空母艦替換拖船，貨船撞擊時會更快地移動。因此，是的，更強大的製造推進器將加快您的轉彎和執行速度。

How did they send people into space in the early days of space exploration without computers and GPS technology?,"Well, there were computers, though they were far more primitive.

How people make a living off investing,"1. They don't make steady income off investments it's an irregular earning pattern. They may have a great day and make thousands or they may have a bad day and lose thousands. 2. Options are contracts to buy or sell stock at a certain price on a certain day in the future. They go up and down in value depending on the value of the underlying stock and likelihood of the option being ""in the money"", ie. paying out on the expiration day. They can swing much more volatility than the underlying stock, and as a result can pay off big. But they can also move the other way and because of the limited time horizon can also very quickly lose everything invested. 3. No, it's not possible to start with $1000. Even $100,000 is virtually impossible to invest as a primary means of income. Making a living off investing is a classic ""takes money to make money"" endeavor.It's boring, but the only really reliable way to make money investing is to invest a bunch of money and then just wait for 10-20 years.

Say it's only 15 minutes, or one phone call a year: that's still 25,000 hours or 32 full time people just to say ""hi"" to your clients once a year. And in reality, it's much more than that: small investors tend to be extremely nervous. Markets go down and you will be flooded with worried investors. Most big investors don't worry about market fluctuations and don't need much hand-holding.

The general principle behind gun control is to make it harder for impulsive people to get their hands on guns - if something is illegal to purchase and now costs 3x what it did when it was legal, you're less likely to buy it for stupid shit.Basically it adds 3 years to the age at which a person can legally obtain a gun. Nothing more really. Would be interesting to see how many crimes are committed with legally obtained guns though",。從大局中看，如何將槍支從18到21的年齡提高到21次真正完成？,老實說，年輕人是愚蠢，衝動的，對自己的行為後果的理解不足。槍支管制背後的一般原則是使衝動的人更難動手使用槍支 - 如果某物是非法的，現在花費了3倍，它在合法時所做的事情，您不太可能因為愚蠢的狗屎而購買它的可能性基本上，它增加了3歲，一個人可以合法獲得槍支的年齡。實際上不再是。很有趣的是，看到有多少罪行犯了合法獲得的槍支
Why do Kenyans consistently outperform other nationalities in long distance running?,"One thing to keep in mind is that the Kenyans who are winning are doing just a few minutes better than the top runners from other countries - it's not as though Kenyans are significantly faster. But there are a lot of reasons they're good at marathons . For one, Kenya is a relatively poor country. This means a lot of things: 1) Most of the jobs are subsistence farming, i.e. a very physical activity says 75% of working Kenyans made their living on the land). As such, the average Kenyan is in good physical shape. 2) Because it's a relatively poor country, there isn't a lot of obesity like there is in other countries. The average Kenyan has a lower BMI. 3) There isn't a lot of infrastructure, so they travel by foot. Running is faster than walking, and if you have a long distance to go, running saves time. So the average Kenyan has some experience with running to begin with. 4) Unrelated to their economy, Kenya has a higher altitude than many countries. If you combine all of these things , you end up with a group of folks with a high VO2 max. This means these folks can absorb more oxygen when breathing, which is key to marathoning, or doing any physical activity for an extended period of time. So that explains why they're good long-distance runners. As to why they compete in so many marathons, remember again that Kenya is a relatively poor country with very few non-farming jobs, and very little by way of secondary education. Not too many ways to make a better life for yourself. But if you know that you're a good runner, and other people from your country have gone off and won marathons , it sounds like a good thing to practice towards and be good at.",為什麼肯尼亞人在長距離跑步的情況下始終超越其他國籍？,要記住的一件事是，贏得勝利的肯尼亞人的表現要比其他國家的頂級跑步者好幾分鐘 - 肯尼亞人似乎並不是要快得多。但是，有很多原因是他們擅長馬拉鬆比賽。首先，肯尼亞是一個相對貧窮的國家。這意味著很多事情：1）大多數工作是生計耕作，即非常體育鍛煉，說肯尼亞人中有75％的工作在土地上謀生）。因此，肯尼亞人的平均身體狀態良好。2）由於它是一個相對較差的國家，所以沒有像其他國家那樣肥胖。肯尼亞人的平均BMI較低。3）沒有很多基礎設施，因此他們步行旅行。跑步比步行快，如果您有很長的距離，可以節省時間。因此，肯尼亞人的普通跑步有一定的經驗。4）與他們的經濟無關，肯尼亞的海拔比許多國家高。如果您將所有這些內容結合在一起，則最終會成為一群最大VO2的人。這意味著這些人在呼吸時可以吸收更多的氧氣，這是馬拉松運動的關鍵或在長時間內進行任何體育活動。因此，這解釋了為什麼他們是很好的長途跑步者。至於為什麼他們參加這麼多馬拉鬆比賽，再次記住肯尼亞是一個相對較差的國家，很少有非農場工作，而通過中等教育很少。為自己帶來更好的生活的方法不是太多。但是，如果您知道自己是一個好跑步者，而來自您國家的其他人已經脫穎而出並贏得了馬拉鬆比賽，那麼練習和擅長的是一件好事。

Why aren't we able to mark SMS's as unread?,"That would actually be very easy. All you need is a button that does the opposite of the function that marks the message as read. I could try seeing if I can modify an open source messenger to mark the messages as unread. One thing you have to think about though is how the unread property is stored: a developer could either store the read or unread property in each individual message or they could store the number of messages received from a contact since the last time their conversation was open and just tell the user the last messages were unread. In that case, you have to either mark all those messages as unread or completely redesign the messenger.",為什麼我們不能將SMS標記為未讀？,這實際上很容易。您只需要一個按鈕，該按鈕與將消息標記為讀取的功能相反。我可以嘗試查看是否可以修改開源信使以將消息標記為未讀。您必須考慮的一件事是如何存儲未閱讀的屬性：開發人員可以將讀取或未讀取屬性存儲在每個單獨的消息中，或者他們可以存儲從聯繫人中收到的消息數，因為他們上次對話開放時只需告訴用戶最後一條消息未讀。在這種情況下，您必須將所有這些消息標記為未閱讀或完全重新設計Messenger。
ELI5: Why are internet entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos of Amazon or Evan Spiegel so much richer than major real estate developers?,"One of the key things to remember is to exclude this bias for ""internet entrepreneurs"" and think of the businesses behind it. Bezos operates a world wide insanely effective and complicated logistics company, perhaps the best in the world! They get tons of stuff from A to B, everywhere in the world, easy, cheaply, and fastly. Thats what Amazon is, its a logistics company. This has incredible value. Many consumers get confused about Amazon, they say ""oh i buy stuff there, oh i watch amazon video or have a tablet by them"". These companies have existed forever, there have been catalog companies and tech an entertainment companies. Amazon is none of those, its all just to support and use their incredible logistics business. Snapchat is an ad platform. Just like say running an ad on the walking dead or billboard on the side of the road or during hot Beatz 106.3 FM's top 40 morning drive show. It's just a method to advertise products. Advertising is big businesses.There are lots of fabulously wealthy developers, including many billionaires, but you haven't heard about them because real estate is boring and very localized. Often the owners will operate at arm's length; lots of people don't even know who owns their apartment building or their office, much less the skyscrapers you see downtown. Most of the richest developers are in Asian countries or India, so it's even less likely you would have heard of them. Lee Shau Kee is worth way way more than Evan Spiegel, for example.Real Estate is a joke. You either start with cash or you get lucky on your bets to make money. You build a brand and scale it. Technology like Amazon is not a joke. It is a marker creating engine for economic growth with a diverse set of solutions. Think of commercial real estate. It grew like crazy last two decades but it was built on a house of cards called department stores. Amazon is showing how to provide products without brick and mortar. Completely dissimilar markets and not comparable in value.",ELI5：為什麼像亞馬遜的傑夫·貝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）或埃文·斯皮格爾（Evan Spiegel）這樣的互聯網企業家比主要的房地產開發商多得多？,要記住的關鍵之一是將這種偏見排除在“互聯網企業家”中，並考慮其背後的企業。貝佐斯（Bezos）經營著一家世界上瘋狂且複雜的物流公司，也許是世界上最好的物流公司！他們從A到B的大量東西，世界上任何地方，輕鬆，便宜，迅速。那就是亞馬遜是一家物流公司。這具有令人難以置信的價值。許多消費者對亞馬遜感到困惑，他們說：“哦，我在那裡買東西，哦，我看了亞馬遜視頻或拿著平板電腦”。這些公司已經永遠存在，已經有目錄公司和技術娛樂公司。亞馬遜不是這些，僅僅是為了支持和利用他們令人難以置信的物流業務。Snapchat是一個廣告平台。就像說在道路側面的行屍走肉或廣告牌上或在熱門節奏106.3 FM的前40個早間駕駛節目中投放廣告一樣。這只是一種廣告產品的方法。廣告是大型企業。包括許多億萬富翁在內的許多非常富有的開發人員，但是您沒有聽說過它們，因為房地產很無聊且非常本地化。業主通常會竭盡全力；許多人甚至都不知道誰擁有他們的公寓樓或辦公室，更不用說您看到的摩天大樓了。大多數最富有的開發商都在亞洲國家或印度，因此您聽說過的可能性更低。例如，Lee Shau Kee比Evan Spiegel更值得。您要么從現金開始，要么幸運地賺錢。您建立一個品牌並擴展它。像亞馬遜這樣的技術不是開玩笑。它是通過各種解決方案創造經濟增長引擎的標記。想想商業房地產。它像瘋狂的持續二十年一樣變得像瘋狂的一樣，但它建在一家名為百貨商店的紙牌房屋上。亞馬遜正在展示如何提供無磚和砂漿的產品。完全不同的市場，價值不相比。

How does lost money affect our economy?,"The power of the dollar will increase, in what is essentially deflation. The quantity of goods and services produced hasn't changed, but the number of dollars circulating to purchase those goods and services has decreased. This means that each dollar will get you a greater quantity of goods and services. While deflation seems good from an individual's standpoint, from the perspective of the overall market it is usually considered bad because it encourages people to hold on to their money rather than spend it. Thus, the government is likely to take corrective action to restore the money supply.",損失的金錢如何影響我們的經濟？,美元的力量將在基本上的通縮方面增加。生產的商品和服務的數量沒有改變，但是購買這些商品和服務的循環數量減少了。這意味著每一美元將為您提供更多的商品和服務。儘管從個人的角度來看，通貨膨脹似乎不錯，但從整個市場的角度來看，它通常被認為是不好的，因為它鼓勵人們堅持自己的錢而不是花錢。因此，政府可能採取糾正措施來恢復貨幣供應。
how does scraping scissors/blade along a ribbon make it curl?,"When you run a blade along a ribbon, you are using force to stretch the polymers beyond their elastic limit causing permanent deformation.

"What does it mean when someone ""jailbreaks"" a phone?","Jailbreaking is just gaining ""root"" access to the phone, giving you control over ALL files.

Why don't fish freeze when the water above does?,"The ice above forms an insulative barrier to keep in the heat from the Earth below and in a bizarre twist the water below the ice is actually slightly above freezing. Some fish, being cold blooded creatures adapt to this situation.Antarctic icefish are a family of fish that are unique because they have no hemoglobin. These fish have glycopeptide and peptide antifreeze compounds which lower the freezing point of their body fluids below the freezing point of seawater. These compounds are made in the liver, secreted into the blood, and distributed to body fluids where they prevent freezing by inhibiting the growth of ice crystals. These fish actually have ice present on their external tissues while their internal tissues are ice free. The presence of ice on the spleen suggests that spleen removes ice crystals from the fishes' circulation. There are other fish that have these antifreeze compounds, not just the Antarctic icefish. p.s.The Antarctic icefish looks really cute in my opinion.

"If 12 years of war has cost us 6 trillion dollars, what have we GAINED financially? Is there a net gain or loss?","I am unable to provide a solid explanation on the 12 year war that you are referring to but, maybe I can provide a typical ELI5 explanation on war and whats the main benefit of it. War is considered as a financial injection to a country that is one of the leading ones on the world. Why? Because every contry that achieved economical greateness inevitably faces overproduction. That basically means that the ammount of things a country produces exceeds the needs of its people. Once that happens, the overproduction should seize because keeping it going will result in loss of money. Limiting the production, means less employment, less investments and generaly leads to economic losses. War is one of the best solutions to that problem. War stimulates the need of various goods so basically you are getting rid of the overproduction. Now this is a very simplictic explanation in layman's language. If you research on the matter, things are far more complex. Overall, once a country gets to an economic standstill due to overproduction, war is one of the best alternatives as it plays the role of a stimulant.",如果12年的戰爭使我們損失了6萬億美元，那麼我們在財務上獲得了什麼？有淨收益還是損失？,我無法對您所指的12年戰爭提供可靠的解釋，但是，也許我可以為戰爭提供典型的ELI5解釋以及它的主要好處。戰爭被認為是世界上領先攻擊國家之一的國家的金融注入。為什麼？因為實現經濟偉大的每一個矛盾都不可避免地面臨過多的生產。這基本上意味著一個國家所產生的事物超出了其人民的需求。一旦發生這種情況，生產過多就應該抓住，因為保持它的運行將導致金錢損失。限制生產，意味著更少的就業機會，減少投資和一般性導致經濟損失。戰爭是解決該問題的最佳解決方案之一。戰爭刺激了各種商品的需求，因此基本上您已經擺脫了過度生產的需求。現在，這是外行語言中非常簡單的解釋。如果您對此事進行研究，事情會更加複雜。總體而言，一旦一個國家由於生產過多而陷入經濟停滯，戰爭是刺激物的作用，這是最好的選擇之一。

But Americans have no particular reason to care about the tax dodges of David Cameron's father or some random member of the EU parliament in Brussels.",為什麼巴拿馬文件洩漏沒有被美國新聞媒體廣泛介紹？,因為很難理解和無聊。現在那個王牌呢？這就像他在說“我們都在想！”，'美國人通常不在乎。好吧，觀看主流媒體的人不在乎，所以他們為什麼要花時間來報導它。而且，經營主流媒體的人可能不喜歡想進一步關注它。因為很少有美國人參與其中。英國廣播公司顯然很感興趣，因為他們的總理與許多其他歐洲政客一起參與。但是，美國人沒有特別的理由關心戴維·卡梅倫父親的稅收避免或布魯塞爾歐盟議會的一些隨機成員。
How can I set up a corporation to purchase my (and everyone else’s) student loan debt and then dissolve the corporation via bankruptcy?,"Nice try, but that won't work. To buy up the debt, your corporation's going to need money. It doesn't have any, so it'll have to either take out a loan from a bank, or sell shares in the corporation to raise some. The bank and the investors are going to ask, ""what's your business plan to pay us back?"" When you as the CEO say you don't have one because you're planning on declaring bankruptcy and sticking them with the debt, they'll kick you out of their office.Short answer is it doesn't work that way. Longer answer is the issuer would have to sell you the debt which they typically won't do unless it's in collections",我如何建立一家公司來購買我（以及其他所有人）的學生貸款債務，然後通過破產來解散公司？,不錯的嘗試，但這不起作用。要購買債務，您的公司將需要錢。它沒有任何東西，因此必須從銀行拿出一筆貸款，或者在公司中出售股票才能籌集一些貸款。銀行和投資者將問：“您還清我們的業務計劃是什麼？”當您擔任首席執行官時，您沒有一個人，因為您打算宣布破產並堅持債務，他們會把您趕出辦公室。回答的答案是，這種情況是行不通的。更長的答案是，發行人將不得不向您出售他們通常不會做的債務，除非收款
Why Australia is protesting right now and what are they protesting over?,"There are a number of issues that people were protesting, but overall it was to show that they feel that the current government is malicious and incompetent due to their policies, comments, and broken promises. This is to do with things like education funding, worker's rights, public assets, social security, and the environment. It's not like what is happening to Turkey and Venezuela, no riots or clashes, just people showing that they are frustrated and scared with what the government intends to do.There are a plethora of reasons that people are protesting at the moment. The current Australian government is not behaving in the interests of the Australian people. They are cutting funding to our education, scientific research, humanitarian aid, renewable energy, health, communication and many other things. For people who care about these sorts of things, the current government is a force of destruction.I think some Redditors are making this seem a lot bigger then it is. Australia has two major political parties; Labor and the Liberals* . Labor was in power for 3 terms until last year when the Liberals came into power. As you might imagine a large percentage of Australian redditors are supporters of the Labor party. This combined with the fact that the current leader of Australia has a fairly low approval rating makes some people a bit angry with the current government. There's a march organised for March which is getting a bit of attention on Reddit but ~~not a whole lot in the mainstream media~~ . In truth there's not a whole lot of protesting. Australians tend to organise protests on a fairly regular basis against the current government. It's a pretty common occurrence and these protests are generally peaceful. I'm happy to explain anything in more detail but as I'm a bit more right wing then some redditors my explanations are probably going to be somewhat different to the other answers. * Technically the Liberals are actually part of the Coalition which includes the Nationals however the Liberals are the bigger/important party.",為什麼澳大利亞現在正在抗議，他們在抗議什麼？,人們正在抗議許多問題，但總的來說，這表明他們認為目前的政府由於其政策，評論和諾言而變得惡意和無能。這與教育資金，工人權利，公共資產，社會保障和環境等事物有關。這並不像土耳其和委內瑞拉發生的事情，沒有騷亂或衝突，只是表明他們對政府打算做的事情感到沮喪和害怕。有很多原因是人們目前正在抗議。現任澳大利亞政府並不符合澳大利亞人民的利益。他們正在為我們的教育，科學研究，人道主義援助，可再生能源，健康，溝通和許多其他事情削減資金。對於關心這類事情的人來說，現任政府是毀滅的力量。我認為有些紅色的人正在使這看起來更大。澳大利亞有兩個主要政黨。勞動與自由主義者*。勞動力持續了3個任期，直到去年自由主義者上台。您可能會想像，很大一部分澳大利亞的紅衣主是工黨的支持者。這與澳大利亞現任領導人的批准率相當低的事實相結合，使某些人對現任政府有些生氣。3月有一個遊行組織，這引起了Reddit的關注，但在主流媒體中並沒有很多。實際上，沒有很多抗議。澳大利亞人傾向於針對現任政府進行相當定期組織抗議活動。這是一個很普遍的情況，這些抗議通常是和平的。我很樂意更詳細地解釋任何內容，但是由於我的右翼要比一些redditors更右翼，我的解釋可能會與其他答案有所不同。*從技術上講，自由黨實際上是包括國民在內的聯盟的一部分，但是自由黨是更大/重要的政黨。
How can the US be trillions in debt but still able to spend over 600 billion in its army?,"Most US debt is owed back to whoever owns it on a set basis. The debt owners will be repaid according to a set schedule. There’s no super bank ready to foreclose on the US government or that controls all US debt. What this means is that the US has to set aside enough each year to pay its debt obligations for that year. This amount is less than what the US government brings in taxes each year, so the difference between the tax income and the amount used to service the debt is what pays for everything else It’s just like how you can be in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and still spend thousands of dollars on groceries every year. Our debt might look big, and certainly is greater than we should probably have, but it’s still only about as much money as the US makes in a single year as its GDP.The US government is in debt because it's borrowed money. As long as it reliably pays back this money, with interest, people will continue lending them more money. Since the government is not a person with a limited lifespan, you don't need to assume their income will cap out or that they will retire some day. As long as you assume the US economy will keep growing & tax revenues will go up, people will keep lending the US government money because it's a safe investment.",美國如何負債數万億美元，但仍然能夠在其軍隊中花費超過6000億美元？,美國大多數債務都歸功於固定的債務。債務所有者將根據設定的時間表進行償還。沒有超級銀行準備喪失美國政府或控制所有美國債務的股份。這意味著美國每年都必須留出足夠的錢才能支付當年的債務義務。這筆款項少於美國政府每年徵收稅款，因此稅收收入與償還債務的金額之間的差額是為其他一切支付的費用債務和仍在每年花費數千美元上的雜貨。我們的債務看起來可能很大，而且肯定比我們可能應該擁有的要大，但是它仍然像美國在一年內與GDP一樣多的錢。只要它可靠地償還這筆錢，就有利益，人們就會繼續向他們藉出更多的錢。由於政府不是一個壽命有限的人，因此您無需假設他們的收入會消失，或者他們有一天會退休。只要您認為美國經濟將繼續增長，稅收收入將增加，人們就會繼續向美國政府貸款貸款，因為這是一項安全的投資。
Why are you required to take the full course of antibiotics even if you start to feel better?,"to ensure that the bacteria are all dead. if you take antibiotics, and stop once you feel better, that doesn't ensure they are all dead. those that survive, could develop resistances to the drugs.",為什麼即使您開始感覺好些，為什麼還要服用完整的抗生素療程？,確保細菌全部死亡。如果您服用抗生素，一旦感覺好些，就不會確保它們都死了。那些生存的人可以產生對藥物的抗性。
"'Modern humans' have existed for 130 to 300 thousand years. Why then do nearly all modern cultures seem to stem back no more than 6,000 years in origin?","Because we spent a very long time pissing about in small little family units getting eaten by wolves and fornicating like primitive pre-civilization primates do. Civilization, or something that we could reasonably call the start of it, occurred around 12,000 years ago when humans finally stopped roaming in an area of the Fertile Crescent and started building stuff. This marked the break point where humans started living in larger and larger communities in a single geographic area. Slowly that led to the development of farming as a primary means of food production and the increase in food availability allowed division of labor which fast forward 12,000 years is why we both have computers and can sit here and talk on the internet.The 300 thousand year old Modern Humans are genetically similar, but were still Hunter-Gatherer tribes. Generally speaking, every person was able to collect enough food for them and their offspring to survive. It was a full time job surviving, so there wasn't much extra that came out of it. Around 10,000 BC, we invented a nice thing called agriculture. By tending our own crops on our own terms, we were able to make it so a single person could produce the food requirements of many people. This is a pretty defining point, because it allowed for people to start doing other things than just surviving. Culture really starts from a little after this point.",“現代人類”已經存在130至30萬年。那麼，為什麼幾乎所有現代文化的起源似乎都不超過6000年？,"因為我們花了很長時間在小的小家族中生氣，被狼和原始的預防靈長類動物像原始的前探測一樣。文明或我們可以合理地稱其為開始的東西發生在12，000年前，當時人類最終停止在肥沃的新月區漫遊並開始建造東西。這標誌著人類開始生活在一個地理區域的越來越大社區中的斷裂點。慢慢地導致農業發展為糧食生產的主要手段，而糧食可用性的增加允許勞動分工，這是我們倆都有計算機並可以坐在這裡進行互聯網交談的原因。30萬年古老的現代人類在遺傳上相似，但仍然是狩獵採集部落。一般而言，每個人都能為他們和他們的後代收集足夠的食物來生存。這是一項倖存的全職工作，因此沒有太多額外的東西。大約公元前10,000年，我們發明了一個叫做農業的好東西。通過以自己的方式撫養自己的農作物，我們能夠做到這一點，以便一個人可以產生許多人的食物要求。這是一個非常明確的觀點，因為它允許人們開始做其他事情，而不是只生存。在此之後，文化確實從一點點開始。"
Why are most of the world's deserts covered in sand and not just dry soil?,"Soil is largely made of sand , organic matter, water, and gas. When you don't have precipitation, you lose out on organic matter and water, so you're left with minerals and rocks that form sand.Most of the world's deserts are actually covered in **snow or ice** . When deserts form, it is because of a lack of moisture. Over time, green grass and healthy topsoil erodes, which leads to a gradual drying out. This then leads to muddiness, then dryness, then cracking, then turning to sand. Sand is really just wind-eroded soil in hot climates.Most deserts are not covered in sand and do have dry soil. But if your'e thinking of the specific deserts that have the vast sand dunes and nothing else, it is because the soil turned to sand. Soil is the minerals and organic components that live in the upper layers, along with water and pockets of air. Take away all the water, and the living things end up dying. Then, the winds will erode the top layers and all the dead living things that have become dust blow away. And you're just left with the sand blowing about. If you rewind the clock to before life left the oceans, there was no soil. Just mud, sand, and rock . And ice and snow, of course. But imagine a large river, coming down the mountains and spreading to a broad alluvial plain and not a single green thing to be seen. Just rock, gravel, and sand. That was the earth before life moved out of the seas.",為什麼世界上大多數沙漠都被沙子覆蓋，而不僅僅是乾燥的土壤？,土壤主要由沙子，有機物，水和氣體製成。當您沒有降水量時，您就會在有機物和水上損失，因此您的礦物質和岩石卻形成了沙子。實際上，世界上大多數沙漠都被**雪或冰覆蓋。當沙漠形成時，這是由於缺乏水分。隨著時間的流逝，綠草和健康的表土侵蝕，導致逐漸乾燥。然後，這會導致泥濘，然後乾燥，然後破裂，然後轉向沙子。沙子實際上只是在炎熱氣候中的風層土壤。大多數沙漠沒有用沙子覆蓋，並且確實有乾燥的土壤。但是，如果您的'思考具有巨大沙丘的特定沙漠，而其他任何東西都沒有，那是因為土壤變成了沙子。土壤是生活在上層的礦物和有機成分，以及水和空氣口袋。拿走所有的水，生物最終死亡。然後，風將侵蝕頂層和所有死去的生物，這些生物已經吹走了。而且您只是吹著沙子。如果您將時鐘倒流到生命離開海洋之前，就沒有土壤。只是泥，沙子和岩石。當然還有冰雪。但是，想像一下一條大河，從山上走到寬闊的沖積平原上，而不是一個綠色的東西。只是岩石，礫石和沙子。那是人生遷出海洋之前的地球。
How are we making higher capacity HDDs year over year while keeping them the same size (or even making them smaller)?,"Don't think of it like storing water in a bucket - water is a physical thing that has a more or less fixed size. We aren't storing a physical thing, we're storing data. Data is abstract and in theory doesn't have any density or size in physical dimensions. Because of this data doesn't have to be stored in a fixed-sized container. It's like writing. When I write out 'Hello, Dave' I'm not storing a physical entity on the paper, I'm storing the thought. Since it's just symbols I don't actually lose anything by writing it as this size^or^this^sizeAs long as it can be read by my reader - so in this case I can see it myself - it's the same amount of data stored in different amounts of space. HDD technology is allowing for smaller 'fonts' that can still be read by the HDD.HDDs use platters covered in magnetic flakes that can be flipped over and read. The limitation for density in these systems are 1) How big are the platters? 2) How many can you fit without making the result too fragile. 3) How many flakes can you pack into a platter without compromising read and write reliability. #1 and #2 are why desktop hard drives store more than laptop, bigger drives carry more platters which are individually larger. #3 has been the driving force behind increased storage.",我們如何使HDD越來越高，同時使它們保持相同的尺寸（甚至使它們變得更小）？,不要將其視為將水存儲在水桶中 - 水是一種或多或少固定尺寸的物理東西。我們不是存儲物理內容，而是在存儲數據。數據是抽象的，理論上沒有任何密度或大小在物理維度中。因為有這些數據，不必存儲在固定尺寸的容器中。就像寫作一樣。當我寫出“你好，戴夫”時，我不是在紙上存儲物理實體時，我正在存儲這個想法。由於它只是符號，我實際上並沒有通過將其寫入此尺寸^或^sizizeas而失去任何東西，只要我的讀者可以讀取它 - 因此，在這種情況下，我可以自己看到它 - 存儲的數據數量相同在不同數量的空間中。HDD技術允許HDD仍然可以讀取較小的“字體”。HDDS使用可以翻轉並讀取的磁片的盤子。這些系統中密度的限制是1）盤子有多大？2）您可以在不使結果過於脆弱的情況下適合幾個。3）您可以在不損害讀寫可靠性的情況下將多少片片包裝到盤子中。＃1和＃2是為什麼桌面硬盤驅動器比筆記本電腦更大的桌面硬盤儲存的原因，更大的驅動器攜帶更多的盤子，這些盤子個體更大。＃3是增加存儲空間的推動力。

Why do our mouths salivate right before throwing up?,"Since stomach contents are highly acidic, vomiting can be quite harmful for the throat, mouth and teeth and salivating helps to reduce this by diluting and rinsing. Saliva is also weakly alkaline, which helps to neutralize acidYour body is smart. Vomit is really acidic and can burn your esophagus. The salivation lines your esophagus and mouth to prevent burningPhysiologist here: Vomiting is a complex physiological response that requires the coordination of the motor, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in order to safely clear the upper GI tract of its contents without causing injury or death to the person some of the highly acidic stomach contents). Saliva does have some capacity to buffer against large pH changes. The buffering capacity of saliva, however, is fairly low - especially against the relatively large volume of low pH stomach contents. Salivation prior to vomiting is a protective mechanism designed to do two things: 1) coat the surfaces of the esophagus/throat/mouth to help protect against the low pH of stomach contents; and 2) lubricate the upper GI tract to make it easier to expel stomach contents.",為什麼我們的嘴在扔之前就唾液？,由於胃含量高度酸性，因此嘔吐可能對喉嚨，牙齒和牙齒有害，而流動有助於通過稀釋和沖洗來減少這種情況。唾液也是微弱的鹼性，有助於中和酸性身體很聰明。嘔吐物確實是酸性的，可以燃燒食管。唾液排隊您的食道和口腔以防止燃燒生理學家：嘔吐是一種複雜的生理反應，需要馬達，交感神經和副交感神經系統的協調，以便安全地清除其內容的上胃腸道，而不會造成傷害或死亡對造成傷害或死亡，使人一些高度酸性的胃含量）。唾液確實具有一些緩衝大型pH變化的能力。然而，唾液的緩衝能力相當低 - 尤其是pH胃含量相對較大。嘔吐之前的唾液是一種保護性機制，旨在做兩件事：1）塗上食道/喉嚨/口的表面，以幫助防止胃含量低的pH值；2）潤滑上胃腸道，以便更容易排除胃含量。
Why are girls in middle school and high school almost always generally more mature than guys in high school and middle school?,"They really are not. Girls tend to be socialized more so they may present the appearance of maturity more often, but they are in no way any more mature on average that boys their age are.It appears that girls' brains are typically going through an organizational stage at 10 to 12 that boys' brains don't typically reach until 15 to 20.

What biologically is happening inside trees that causes them to bloom after a week of warm weather?,"you quite answered by yourself: Normally we have modeled the phenomenon with the [Degree day] which is somewhat the energy taken in a certain period of time. Of course the answer is much more complex of this *because* in reality there are many ways plants adopted to control the blooming, depending on where the habitat of the plant is. second question: yes.

Why all the planets are turning in the same direction,"They dont . Venus, Uranus rotate clockwise, the rest rotate counter-clockwise. When the solar system was first forming, it was nothing but a giant cloud of dust, and because of gravity and the Sun, it had a counter-clockwise spin to it, and as the planets began to form, they kept this rotation, which is why they all revolve around the sun in the same direction. Venus and Uranus are theorized to have clockwise rotations because they were probably impacted by large planetoids early in their development, which shifted their rotational axis, and in the case of Uranus, completely shifted the axis to horizontal.",為什麼所有行星都朝著相同的方向轉動,他們沒有。金星，天王星順時針旋轉，其餘的逆時針旋轉。當太陽系首次形成時，它不過是巨大的灰塵雲，由於重力和太陽，它具有逆時針方向的旋轉，隨著行星開始形成，他們保持了這種旋轉，這就是為什麼它們都朝著相同方向圍繞太陽旋轉的原因。從理論上講，金星和天王星具有順時針旋轉，因為它們的發育早期可能受到大型行星的影響，從而改變了它們的旋轉軸，並且在天王星的情況下，它們將軸完全轉移到水平上。

Why aren't human races classified as species like animals are?,"There is greater genetic difference between two individuals than there are between the ""races"", the concept of race is fundamentally superficial genetically speaking, in fact humans are one of the most homogeneous species known to exist For two animals to be considered different species, they must not be able to produce successful offspring - this is clearly not the case with different races of humanThe difference between human races are like the difference between one zebras stripes and another zebras stripes.Much the same reason that Labrador, Pug and Irish Setter are not species. There are genetic differences between them that are in fact much smaller than you would imagine judging from their appearance. At the end of the day they're just all dogs.Animals of the same species are not classified as different species unless a mistake has been made. Why would we then purposely classify the species Homo sapiens as different species?', ""One of the criteria for having a separate species of the same animal is the relative 'genetic distance' between two individuals of a species. Namely, this term means how different two different members of the same species compare in the structure of both of their genes. For example, let's have humans A and B. A is a human that lives and whose ancestors lived in Brazil, B is a human who lives and has lived in Kazakhstan. While their skin pigment, retinal pigment, and hair pigment may be different in terms of color and structure, you can find all of the data that codes for their respective traits on the same place in their genome. Thus, their genetic distance is close enough for them to be classified as the same species.",為什麼不歸類為像動物這樣的物種的人類種族？,兩個個體之間的遺傳差異比“種族”之間的遺傳差異更大，種族的概念在根本上是遺傳上膚淺的，實際上，人類是已知存在的兩種動物已知的最均勻的物種之一，它們被認為是不同的物種，它們是它們的。一定不能產生成功的後代 - 與人類種族之間的差異顯然不是這種情況，就像一個斑馬條紋和另一個斑馬條之間的差異一樣。同樣的原因是拉布拉多，帕格和愛爾蘭的setter也不是物種。它們之間存在遺傳差異，實際上比您想像的要小得多。歸根結底，它們只是所有的狗。然後，我們為什麼要故意將同性戀物種分類為不同的物種？”，“擁有同一動物的單獨物種的標準之一是物種兩個個體之間的相對“遺傳距離”。也就是說，這個術語意味著如何同一物種的不同兩個不同的成員在其兩個基因的結構中都有比較。在哈薩克斯坦。雖然它們的皮膚色素，視網膜色素和髮色素可能在顏色和結構方面有所不同，但您可以在其基因組中的同一位置找到所有編碼它們各自特徵的數據。因此，它們的遺傳距離足夠近使它們被歸類為同一物種。
Why is Contemporary art held in museums but all other art is held and shown in galleries?,"I think your straw poll may have misled you the artists you describe generally have their art in museums, not galleries. For example, Da Vinci art in museums . Contemporary art can be in both galleries and museums. I believe it has to do with the intent of the art. Museums are for viewing.

How do leggings keep somebody warm in the fall and winter months?,"Short answer: Fashion is about making sacrifices, and its no wonder women always complain about being cold. Long answer: Its a factor of a number of things. Women shave their legs, and hair is specifically designed to keep people warm. Leggings do a number of things. first, they act as insulation, by helping to trap heat in the body. They also have their own heat capacity, so that your body isn't affected by every little draft and breeze . But for all of the above, it only works to a point. Try googling techniques on improving insolation if you're curious; there's some really cool stuff out there to learn. Girls are willing to freeze their butts off to look good when its cold enough. Also, if they're inside most of the time, its not as bad. Its only a problem if they're outside for longer periods of time, and not just walking from the car to the store. It all comes down to insulation and thermal storage.",綁腿如何在秋季和冬季保持溫暖？,簡短的答案：時尚是關於做出犧牲的，這也就不好了，女性總是抱怨很冷。長答案：這是許多事情的因素。女人剃光雙腿，專門設計頭髮以保持人們的溫暖。綁腿做很多事情。首先，它們通過幫助將熱量捕獲體內的熱量來充當絕緣。他們也有自己的熱量，因此您的身體不會受到每一大吃一經和微風的影響。但是對於上述所有方面，它只能達到一定程度。如果您很好奇，請嘗試使用谷歌搜索技術來改善暴發；那裡有一些很酷的東西可以學習。女孩願意將屁股凍結，以便在足夠寒冷的情況下看起來不錯。另外，如果它們大部分時間都內在，那就不那麼糟糕了。如果他們在外面呆了更長的時間，而不僅僅是從汽車到商店，這只是一個問題。這一切都歸結為絕緣和熱存儲。

How do unripe bananas develop at home?,"They're fully grown before they start to ripen. The ripening process is caused by the plant growth regulator 'ethylene', and begins to turn starch in the banana into sugar. Bananas are not the only fruit to work this way . It's a common survival strategy because it lets you make sure your seeds and fruit are fully mature before anything tries to eat it .",未成熟的香蕉如何在家中發展？,它們在開始成熟之前就完全長大了。成熟過程是由植物生長調節劑“乙烯”引起的，並開始將香蕉中的澱粉變成糖。香蕉不是這樣工作的唯一水果。這是一種普遍的生存策略，因為它可以確保在任何東西吃東西之前，都可以確保種子和水果完全成熟。
why dont ants drown when it rains?,"My understanding: First, in a rainstorm, lots of ants drown. Even being well prepared for an event like a flood doesn't mean everyone survives, and not every plan is executed perfectly. The best laid plans of ants and men, etc . . . Second, different species take different approaches. Some fire ants just link legs/arms, turn into living rafts, and float to somewhere new, where they can build a new nest. Same thing with some Amazonian ants when they need to cross rivers. Some construct the opening of their nests to resist penetration by water. From what I 've seen briefly researching, the most common strategy is just building in the right place. Ants build their nests in soil that dries quickly and water doesn't necessarily penetrate that far, so they can just go deeper and wait out the wetness. Think of this last bit like adding water to flour when you're making bread. Even if the water ""floods"" the top layer of flour, unless you mix it, the bottom layer will stay quite dry. If the ants nest extends below that wet/dry barrier, than it will stay dry. So, to sum up, Some ants just go with the flow. Some reinforce against water, and many build in places where flooding is likely to do only manageable damage. And, when these strategies don't work, they die.",為什麼螞蟻下雨時不淹死？,我的理解：首先，在暴雨中，很多螞蟻淹死了。即使為像洪水這樣的事件做好準備並不意味著每個人都能生存，並不是每個計劃都完美地執行。螞蟻和男人等最好的計劃等。。。其次，不同的物種採用不同的方法。一些火螞蟻只是連接腿/手臂，變成活木筏，然後漂浮到新的地方，在那裡它們可以建造一個新的巢穴。當一些亞馬遜螞蟻需要跨河流時，也有同樣的事情。有些人構造了巢的開口，以抵抗水的穿透。從我所看到的簡短研究中，最常見的策略只是在正確的位置建立。螞蟻在迅速乾燥的土壤中建立巢穴，水不一定要穿透那麼遠，因此它們可以更深地等待濕潤。想想最後一點，就像在製作麵包時向麵粉添加水一樣。即使水“氾濫”麵粉的頂層，除非將其混合，否則底層也會保持乾燥。如果螞蟻巢延伸到濕/幹屏障以下，則它將保持乾燥。因此，總而言之，有些螞蟻只是順其自然。有些人加強了水，許多人在洪水可能只造成可管理的損害的地方建造。而且，當這些策略不起作用時，它們就會死亡。

How come anti-trust/monopoly laws are no longer pursued in the United States?,"They are actually enforced more than they *ever* have been. Its just a much more complex and ""known"" situation now, that its very very uninteresting to report on for the media, so unless you're very inovolved in how this stuff works in specific industries of business, you'll probably never hear about all of the stuff going on. Pretty much everyone in business, economics, and the govt agencies simply know how all of this stuff can work, and will work, and there isn't too many unknowns out there any more, which makes it so that all of these mergers and stuff, you simply don't do it unless its legitimate, because thats bad business to have stuff denied. The US Federal Trade Commission who is the main US agency who deals with this type of stuff, is also considered to be crazy good at their job, and the world's gold standard-- basically, they know their shit, everyone knows they know their shit, so they make things very reasonable, enforceable, and known.

Why does adding vanilla to boiling sugar (like when making fudge) cause it to bubble/boil rapidly?,"Sugar-water has a higher boiling point than pure water, and the more sugar is dissolved, the higher that point is. So when you've got boiling syrup, it might be 230 or 240 degrees . When you pour vanilla extract onto something that hot, it's *going* to boil, since it's got an even lower boiling point than water, since it contains a lot of alcohol.Vanilla extract contains about 35% alcohol. As soon as it touches the screaming hot sugar, the alcohol pretty much instantly boils from liquid to gas. The sudden rush of gas moves relatively slowly through the thick sugar, causing a huge burst of bubbles as it escapes.",為什麼在沸騰的糖中添加香草（例如製作軟糖時）會導致它迅速起泡/沸騰？,糖水的沸點比純水更高，糖溶解的越多，那一點就越高。因此，當您煮沸糖漿時，可能是230或240度。當您將香草提取物倒在熱的東西上時，它會 *煮沸，因為它的沸點比水還低，因為它含有很多酒精。Vanilla提取物含有約35％的酒精。一旦觸及尖叫的熱糖，酒精幾乎立即從液體到氣體沸騰。氣體的突然衝動相對緩慢地穿過濃糖，導致氣泡逸出。

How does traction control on a car work?,"You can think of traction control as basically ABS in reverse. When you accelerate, the car senses whether the tires are slipping on the pavement. If they are, it will automatically adjust the throttle to help them keep tractionTraction control is basically the opposite of the Anti-blocking system that almost every modern car has. It prevents the wheels of losing grip on the track/road/surface by limiting the power output that goes to the wheels. The means by which this is done is via computer that monitors the rotation of the wheels. Once it detects that one of the driving wheels is spinning faster then the other it immediately limits the power and torque going to this wheel. The mechanics behind the process are a bit difficult to explain as it includes clever differentials, shutting down whole cylinders in the engine, retarding the ignition spark etc etc. Check google for more info on the matter. Hope I helped.",汽車上的牽引力控制如何工作？,您可以認為牽引力控制基本上是ABS。當您加速時，汽車會感覺到輪胎是否在人行道上滑動。如果是這樣，它將自動調整油門以幫助他們保持牽引力控制，這基本上與幾乎每輛現代汽車都具有的反塊系統相反。它通過限制進入車輪的功率輸出來防止在軌道/道路/表面上失去抓地力的車輪。完成此操作的手段是通過計算機來監視車輪旋轉的。一旦它發現一個駕駛輪的旋轉速度之一，另一個駕駛速度就會立即限制動力和扭矩。該過程背後的機制很難解釋，因為它包括巧妙的差速器，關閉發動機中的整個氣缸，延遲點火火花等等。查看Google以獲取有關此事的更多信息。希望我幫忙。
Why do fan power knobs go 0-3-2-1,"Things like well pumps have electric motors like fans do. They require a capacitor to get the motor going and then the normal current can sustain it. Like how you can't start in 5th gear but you can drive in fifth gear after you get going. Fans have this configuration to extend the life of the fan. They can normally start on one when they are new, but over time the lube wears down and dust gets in there and friction grows and this friction needs to be overcome to get the fan going. When it gets bad 1 won't work if you switch it directly to it. You need to start it on 3 and then it can keep going on 1. Putting 3 first allows for this to be done without most people noticing and allows the fan a longer lifespan before someone decides it's broken.You need to start the fan in high speed, that switch arrangement guarantees that. The low speed setting does not provide enough energy to make the fan go from stop. It will just sit there, potentially burning out.

Why do construction workers use big tall tower things to pour concrete? Pic Inside,"That's called a [concrete pump]. It's used when you need to inject pressurized concrete someplace rather than just pouring it.

Why does it seem like video games from the newest generation seem to have far more bugs and glitches than previous generation games?,"A few factors * New games are way more complex. This means more code, and as the number of bugs per LoC is pretty static you get more bugs.* Today it is pretty trivial to push patches to the users as they have fast internet.* Deadlines have become a bigger factor esp. when it comes to franchise titles.Video games are becoming bigger and better. This means more people are working on them, more elements have to mesh together, and more code is being written. If we assume that there are the same number of bugs per 1000 lines of code as always, then a program with 20 000 lines of code will have twice the number of bugs as a program with 10 000 lines of code. Secondly, more and more people are playing games than before, with more and more diverse hardware. This means that devs simply cannot test every single configuration of processor+GPU+RAM+Mobo that's in existence, which could lead to weird results in some cases. Also as more and more people are playing them, that means more hours of playtime which again, devs can't test for - even working full time for 6 months with a team of 100 testers, you'd still have only 104 000 hours of gametime. For a game like Call of Duty all it takes is everyone that buys it on launch day to play it for probably less than 30 minutes to hit that same amount of play time. As playtime increases, the chance to run into something the dev did not expect and account for increases as well. Lastly, and this one is the weakest explanation, part of it is very likely due to the ease of patching games nowadays. Before everyone had high-speed internet, if you released a buggy game people would be out for blood because there was no way to fix it. Nowadays it's ridiculously easy to push an update through Steam, sometimes even on launch day before your customers have even noticed.",為什麼最新一代的視頻遊戲似乎比上一代遊戲更多的錯誤和故障？,一些因素 *新遊戲更為複雜。這意味著更多的代碼，並且由於每個LOC的錯誤數量非常靜止，因此您會得到更多的錯誤。*今天，將補丁推向用戶，因為它們具有快速的Internet。*截止日期已成為更大的因素ESP。當涉及特許經營標題時。這意味著越來越多的人正在研究它們，更多的元素必須融合在一起，並且正在編寫更多的代碼。如果我們假設每1000行代碼的錯誤數量與往常相同，那麼具有20 000行代碼的程序將具有兩倍的錯誤數量，即帶有10 000行代碼的程序。其次，越來越多的人在玩遊戲，擁有越來越多樣化的硬件。這意味著開發人員根本無法測試現有的每種配置的處理器+GPU+RAM+MOBO，這在某些情況下可能會導致奇怪的結果。同樣，隨著越來越多的人在玩遊戲，這意味著更多的遊戲時間，這是開發人員無法測試的 - 即使是由100個測試人員組成的團隊全職工作6個月，您仍然只有104 000小時的小時遊戲時間。對於像《使命召喚》這樣的遊戲，只需在發布日購買它即可在不到30分鐘的時間裡播放它以達到相同數量的遊戲時間。隨著比賽時間的增加，遇到開發人員沒有期望並增加增加的機會也會增加。最後，這是最薄弱的解釋，部分原因很可能是由於如今的修補遊戲易於修補。在每個人都擁有高速互聯網之前，如果您發布了一個越野車遊戲，人們就會出血，因為沒有辦法修復它。如今，通過Steam推動更新是非常容易的，有時甚至在您的客戶注意到之前的發布會上也是如此。
Why do India and China have such massive populations in comparison to the rest of the world?,"I'm almost certain this has been answered before, but it's largely due to geography. India and China both have exceptionally fertile river valleys capable of supporting large populations with pre-industrial technology.

Why babies are capable of learning a language so easily,"During early development, the brain is much more plastic, meaning making new connections, erasing old ones, and rearranging existing ones is much easier.

An adult can't even begin to make sense of a language they don't understand, because they can't hear the difference between the core sounds used in that language.",為什麼嬰兒能夠如此輕鬆地學習語言,在早期開發過程中，大腦更具塑料，這意味著建立新的連接，擦除舊的連接，並且重新安排現有的連接要容易得多。另外，由於嬰兒出生時沒有任何語言，因此據信他們識別和記住一種語言使用的元音聲音要容易得多。成年人甚至無法開始理解他們不了解的語言，因為他們聽不到該語言中使用的核心聲音之間的區別。

How is the routing number on a check used?,"A check is an instruction by you to your bank: when the person named on the check requests it, pay them the amount indicated on the check, from the bank account of which the number is on the check. This means that at the end of the day, it's always your bank cashing the check. But it's convenient if the person you want to pay can deposit the check at their own bank--and even better if this payment can be processed electronically. This means that the bank accepting the check needs an obvious, consistent way to identify the bank that will pay out. The routing number is the solution. Each bank in the U.S. that participates in the Automated Clearinghouse is assigned a routing number. The bank that accepts the check can send the information to the ACH, which will identify the the bank on which the check is drawn, and ask it to make the payment. When the bank that originally accepted the check receives the payment, it's credited to the payee's account at that bank.The routing number on your check is one of three numbers printed on the check: Routing #:Account#:Check# The routing number tells the receiving bank what bank to get the money from. The account number tells them what customer to take the money from. The check number is there to insure nothing fishy is going on with duplicated checks or whatnotIt is simply a unique number assigned to a bank, so that a machine can instantly sort a group of checks by what bank the accounts come from. Then the checks payable by each bank can be sent to that bank.",如何使用支票上的路由號？,支票是您向銀行的指示：當支票請求命名的人時，請從支票上指示的金額支付數字在支票上的銀行帳戶。這意味著，歸根結底，始終是您的銀行兌現支票。但是，如果您要付款的人可以將支票存入自己的銀行，甚至可以通過電子方式處理這筆付款，這很方便。這意味著接受支票的銀行需要一種明顯，一致的方法來識別將要支付的銀行。路由號是解決方案。參加自動交換所的美國的每個銀行都分配了一個路由號。接受支票的銀行可以將信息發送給ACH，這將確定繪製支票的銀行，並要求其進行付款。當最初接受支票的銀行收到付款時，將其記入該銀行的收款人帳戶。支票上的路由號是支票上打印的三個號碼之一：路由＃：帳戶＃：檢查＃路由號碼告訴接收銀行從什麼銀行那裡獲得錢。帳號告訴他們要從什麼客戶那裡拿走錢。檢查號碼是為了確保重複的支票或其他功能僅僅是分配給銀行的唯一號碼，因此機器可以立即按帳戶來自的銀行對一組支票進行分類。然後，可以將每個銀行應支付的支票發送給該銀行。
The South Australian Statewide power outage and upstream transmission supply of power,"It means all in-state power plants are offline and the lines that bring power in from out of state are down aswell, they may physically be damaged or they cant handle that amount of power so they shut them off so they dont burn up', ""An electrical grid relies on a balance of consumption and production of electricity. It's not like a water distribution network where you can build a big tank or lake and temporarily store water there, while waiting for consumers to need it. Every bit of electricity withdrawn from the grid must be produced at the same time , and every bit of electricity deposited into the grid must be used up by somebody immediately. You can store electricity in batteries, but there is no battery setup that's big and effective enough for the whole electrical grid of a state or nation. So while South Australia largely manages its own electrical grid - they have their own power stations, their own market and pricing, local companies that own the wires, etc. - it's got a few very big-capacity connections to the Australia-wide grid. Because that grid is bigger, it's called an **upstream** grid. Whenever local consumers need more electricity than the local power stations can give them, the difference is received from the Aus-wide grid. Whenever local consumers are not consuming, the local power stations send their power to the Aus-wide grid. In this case the statement means that there is no electricity coming into the South Australia's grid at the points where it is connected to the Aus-wide grid. Either because the connection points are broken, or because the Aus-wide doesn't have any spare electricity to give.",南澳大利亞州全州的停電和上游傳輸電力供應,這意味著所有州內發電廠均處於離線狀態，從州外發電的線路也是如此，它們可能會受到物理損壞，或者他們無法承受這些量，因此他們將其關閉，以免燃燒'，'“電網取決於消費和電力的平衡。這不像是水分配網絡，您可以在這裡建造一個大型坦克或湖泊，並在等待消費者需要的同時臨時存儲水。從網格中必須同時生產，並且沉積在網格中的每一點都必須立即被某人用盡。因此，一個州或國家的網格。因此，雖然南澳大利亞在很大程度上管理自己的電網 - 他們擁有自己的電站，自己的市場和價格，擁有電線等的本地公司等等 - 它具有一些非常大的能力連接到達澳大利亞範圍的網格。因為該網格更大，所以稱為上游**網格。每當本地消費者需要的電力比本地電站所能提供的電力更多時，就會從澳大利亞網格獲得差異。每當本地消費者不消費時，當地電站都會將其電源發送到澳大利亞的網格。在這種情況下，該聲明意味著在與澳大利亞網格連接的地方沒有電力進入南澳大利亞的網格。要么是因為連接點被打破，要么是因為澳大利亞範圍內沒有任何備用電力。

What are the causes of the Great Depression?,"The Great Depression was caused by many factors but one of the largest was a gross misuse of credit. Basically in the 1920s people began buying things on credit This was all well and good but there where no real safety measures in place and people spent much MUCH more then they actually had. The result was an incredibly boosted economy but it just couldn't last. So on Black Tuesday the house of cards collapsed, the Stock Market crashed spectacularly, overnight people lost millions. This caused a panic as people rushed to the bank to withdraw their cash, but since the banks use the money given to them to invest they did not have it on hand and much of it died in the stock market crash as well. The result was that the bank could not provide people with all of their money. A double whammy also occurred in the Midwest where the Dust Bowl hit, a disaster caused from overfarming and drought, the dust bowl would go on to decimate US crops and utterly destroy the lives of many farmers.",大蕭條的原因是什麼？,大蕭條是由許多因素引起的，但最大的是對信用的嚴重濫用。基本上，在1920年代，人們開始以信用額度購買東西，這一切都很好，但是沒有真正的安全措施，人們花費的時間比他們實際擁有的要多得多。結果是一個令人難以置信的經濟增長，但無法持續。因此，在黑色星期二，紙牌屋倒塌了，股市崩潰了，一夜之間損失了數百萬人。當人們趕到銀行撤回現金時，這引起了恐慌，但是由於銀行利用給他們的錢進行投資，因此他們沒有手頭，其中大部分也死於股市崩潰。結果是銀行無法為人們提供所有的錢。在中西部也發生了雙重打擊，那裡的塵土碗擊中，造成過度燃燒和乾旱造成的災難，塵埃碗將繼續削弱美國的農作物，並徹底摧毀了許多農民的生命。

What is a lame-duck Congress (United States),"In politics, ""Lame Duck"" is used to describe to period of time between an Election and when the winners of that election assume office. A President who lost or did not campaign for a Second Term in November, for example, is called a ""Lame Duck President"" until the new President takes office in January. A Lame-Duck Congress, therefore, is Congress between when the General Election takes place and when the New Congress takes office .A lame-duck is a general term for a person that has a job, but knows that he won't have it for much longer. An example would be an incumbent politician that has has lost an election, but still has to serve until his time is up. Another example is a contract worker that won't have his contract renewed, but still has time on his contract. People are critical of lame-ducks because they no longer have the same motivations. No matter what they do, they will still lose their jobs. Lame-ducks tend to be lazy and don't do anything.Lame duck means the time between an election and when officials go into office. Those who are in office who are not elected become ""lame ducks."" So, for example, Obama will be a lame duck president following the next presidential election, up until he steps down for the incoming president.",什麼是la腳的大會（美國）,在政治上，“ la腳鴨”用於描述選舉之間的一段時間，而當選舉的贏家擔任職務。例如，在11月失去或沒有競選第二任期的總統被稱為“ la腳鴨總統”，直到一月份新總統上任。因此，la腳的大會是在大選進行何時與新國會上任時。更長的時間。一個例子是現任政治家，失去了選舉，但仍必須服務直到他的時間到了。另一個例子是合同工，他的合同不會續簽，但仍然有時間簽訂合同。人們批評la腳，因為他們不再具有相同的動機。無論他們做什麼，他們仍然會失業。la腳往往會很懶惰，什麼也不做。鴨子意味著選舉與官員上任之間的時間。那些沒有當選的人成為“ la腳的鴨子”。因此，例如，奧巴馬將在下次總統大選之後成為la腳的鴨總統，直到他辭職為即將上任的總統為止。

Why is fire used to make land fertile? Wouldn't the heat from the flames cause a dust bowl effect?,"Fire is GOOD for nature for many reasons; you may have heard that coniferous trees will only spread their seeds when the heat from a fire melts the resins in the cones and allows them to open up. Fire is also beneficial in that, once the trees are burned, the remaining ashes contain lots of nutrients that will aid in the regrowth of the area. Mountainous areas with lots of trees aren't as prone to the dust bowl effect because the dead trees still prevent the wind from blowing at gale forces.

Why isn't car bodywork made from stainless steel?,"Because its too expensive. But that didn't stop DMC from building the deLorean. Thank goodness for poor business decisions.Because the cost of making the entire body from stainless steel would drive the price up out of range for most peopleSeveral reasons: 1. Stainless steel is expensive, about 50% more per pound than mild steel, even at scrap prices. It's actually an alloy of steel and several other materials such as chromium, nickel and aluminum. 2. Stainless steel is tough. Way tougher than than the milder steel used in car panels. It's much more difficult to mold, bend, cut and weld. 3. You can't paint it. Stainless steel doesn't hold paint very well. If we used stainless steel for car panels there would only be one color - stainless. was pretty sweet) 4. It's not really ""stainless."" Although much more resistant than regular steel, stainless steel can and will rust just like the cheaper stuff, left exposed to the the sun and rain and road salt.

What would happen if all bacteria was removed from my body?,"The vast majority of cells in your body are bacterial cells , so the effects of removing all bacteria would be widespread and effectively leave us unable to survive. Removing bacteria from the gut would prevent absorption of many vital nutrients. This is actually one of the dangers of taking antibiotics too aggressively: they kill all bacteria, good and bad, and can lead to malnutrition and other complications. Bacteria also utterly occupy our skin and actually out-compete many dangerous species of bacteria. Without these benign bacteria growing on your skin, you'd be more prone to infection. This is a major reason why doctors don't recommend constantly using antibacterial creams and the like.

How does radiation do damage to your body?,"Low-energy radiation isn't dangerous because it has so little energy. Getting pelted by photons from a lamp is like having sand thrown at you, it simply cannot harm you. If radio waves are comparable to sand then the other end of the spectrum are .50cal rounds. They impart enough energy to physically break down your cells. If you're subjected to that kind of radiation it's strong enough to damage your DNA which can lead to mutations and cancer. Past certain point the radiation doesn't just damage the cells, it just plain kills them by breaking down the structures they are made of. Extreme exposure leads to what you see in the picture.",輻射如何傷害您的身體？,低能輻射並不危險，因為它的能量很少。用燈從光子上撫慰光子就像向您扔沙子一樣，它根本不會傷害您。如果無線電波與沙子相當，則光譜的另一端是.50頻彈。它們具有足夠的能量來物理分解您的細胞。如果您受到這種輻射的影響，則足夠強大以損害您的DNA，從而導致突變和癌症。過去的某個點，輻射不僅會損壞細胞，而且只會通過分解它們的結構來殺死它們。極端的暴露會導致您在圖片中看到的東西。
"how a ""stimulus package"" helps out the economy.","What you have described is known as ""quantitative easing"". A stimulus is when the government takes out a bunch of loans and uses that money to buy things, often paying for infrastructure improvements . You may have noticed a lot of road work on the highway recently This is likely stimulus money at work. **ELI5 Part:**Think about it this way: What happens when you buy something from a friend? You give the friend a twenty dollar bill, and you get your item . Then, he/she goes out and buys two sodas from another friend, and so on and so forth. Now, imagine that instead of a twenty, you use a fifty. Now, you can buy 2.5x more stuff. To fill that want, your friend makes five hotdogs to sell to you instead of two. But, in order to make five hotdogs, he/she has to hire another person to help him/her make more hotdogs. This is a concept known as circular flow, and it is a central tenet of macroeconomics. In reality, it is a bit more complicated than this but this is supposed to be an ELI5, after all. For more on the topic take Macroeconomics 101, or watch these videos on Khanacademy: _URL_2URL_1URL_0_So there's this old British economist names James Maynard Keynes, who was behind what people now call ""Keynesian economics."" Keynesian economics says that in a depression, the government needs to pump money into the country, and run at a deficit. The reason Obama approved the stimulus package this time was because it worked when we had to use it during the great depression. FDR passed the New Deal, which was a sort of stimulus package, and the influx of money into the economy helped to bring it out of depression.",“刺激套餐”如何幫助經濟。,您所描述的被稱為“定量寬鬆”。一個刺激是政府拿出一大堆貸款並利用這些錢來購買東西的時候，經常為改進基礎設施付費。最近，您可能已經註意到高速公路上的大量公路工作可能是工作中的刺激資金。** eli5部分：**這樣想：當您從朋友那裡購買東西時會發生什麼？您給朋友一張二十美元的賬單，然後得到您的物品。然後，他/她出去，從另一個朋友那裡買了兩個蘇打，依此類推。現在，想像一下，您使用的是五十。現在，您可以購買2.5倍的東西。為了填補想要的東西，您的朋友製作了五個熱狗，而不是兩個。但是，為了製作五個熱狗，他/她必須僱用另一個人來幫助他/她做更多的熱狗。這是一個稱為圓流流的概念，它是宏觀經濟學的核心原則。實際上，它比這要復雜一些，但畢竟應該是ELI5。有關該主題的更多信息，請使用宏觀經濟學101，或者在Khanacademy上觀看這些視頻：_url_2url_1url_0_so_so，有一個英國經濟學家詹姆斯·梅納德·凱恩斯（James Maynard Keynes），他現在稱為“凱恩斯主義經濟學”。凱恩斯主義的經濟學說，在蕭條中，政府需要向該國抽取資金，並處於赤字狀態。奧巴馬這次批准刺激包的原因是因為它在大蕭條期間不得不使用它時起作用。FDR通過了新交易，這是一種刺激套餐，經濟湧入的資金湧入，使它擺脫了抑鬱症。

what happens if you leave the microwave door open and it's turned on?,"Microwaves are electromagnetic radiation with fairly large wavelength. If you take away the spinning mechanism and put in something like a block of cheese, you'll pretty reliably be able to see that the heat will most be applied in certain sections.

"""Happy"" music versus ""Dark, depressing"" music. Why do we see either as being such? What makes a certain combination of notes fit in either category?","There is a learned history involved. Music and language are very closely related. Think of someone expressing sorrow or sympathy in a western language. Often there is a sigh, which falls down slightly with the sound going softer. Now listen to the lachrymosa from the Requiem by Mozart and you can hear this sigh in the violins. Mozart plays with the sigh by inverting the shape etc but that affect is present through that movement. And if you look at music that evokes sadness you will find this sigh figure. Check out Barbers adagio, it occurs over and over again. Or listen to the Bach violin sonata in G Minor, the adagio. Now for keys and their relationship to sadness. Before pianos and in the early renaissance, the modes were popular tools for composing. Today, modes that we would define as sad, were used as modes for things that were happy or calming. But as music started to have a stronger relationship with vertical function over horizontal counterpoint, you start to see the modes shift roles. It was a long evolution, and part of it is based on these emotive gestures becoming a part of the western music dialect. The key that fit really well with that sigh figure happens to be minor. And there are a great deal more gestures. Like something joyous often has a jump up of a fourth and sixth. Take for example happy birthday or the wedding march by Wagner. Now relate that what your voice naturally does when you get excited by seeing a friend you like ""oh hey!"" Or when you win a game and get excited and yell ""hell yes!"" This is a very brief survey answer to your question and if you like I could try and find some examples for you.",“快樂”音樂與“黑暗，令人沮喪”的音樂。為什麼我們認為是這樣的？是什麼使一定的音符組合適合這兩個類別？,有一個學識淵博的歷史。音樂和語言密切相關。想想一個人對西方語言表達悲傷或同情的人。通常會有嘆息，聲音柔和。現在，聽莫扎特的《安魂曲》中的lachrymosa，您可以聽到小提琴的嘆息。莫扎特通過反轉形狀等而歎了口氣，但是這種影響是通過這種運動而產生的。而且，如果您看著喚起悲傷的音樂，您會發現這個嘆息的人物。查看理髮師Adagio，它一遍又一遍地發生。或聽Adagio的G Minor中的Bach小提琴奏鳴曲。現在是鑰匙及其與悲傷的關係。在鋼琴和早期文藝復興時期，這些模式是流行的作曲工具。如今，我們將定義為悲傷的模式被用作快樂或平靜的事物的模式。但是，隨著音樂開始與水平對位的垂直功能建立更牢固的關係，您開始看到模式轉移角色。這是一個漫長的演變，其中一部分是基於這些情感手勢成為西方音樂方言的一部分。與該嘆息數字非常適合的鑰匙恰好是次要的。而且還有更多的手勢。就像歡樂的事一樣，通常會跳高第四和第六。以瓦格納的生日快樂或婚禮遊行為例。現在，當您看到一個喜歡“哦嘿！”的朋友而興奮時，您的聲音自然而然地做到了。或者，當您贏得比賽並感到興奮並大喊“地獄是！”這是對您的問題的簡短調查答案，如果您喜歡我可以嘗試為您找到一些示例。
What's the opioid crisis?,"I work in healthcare. The opioid crisis is this situation in America where it is seen that providers are prescribing opioids much more liberally than how they should. There are several studies that show how addictive these opioids can be and that innocent people can become addicted with a simple 5-7 day dose following surgery. The problem that laypeople fail to realize is that medicine has become a patient satisfaction industry. If I feel pressured by a patient to write them opioids, I know I’m about to run into trouble. They are more likely to be dissatisfied when I refuse to give them opioids that I feel are not indicated, with the possibility of taking me to court. Now this is where the fun begins. They may win a suit against me for “not being compassionate to help them alleviate their pain while I have the power to do so”. On the flip side, if I prescribe opioids , I can be sued for them becoming addicted. Honestly there is no way to win even with perfect medical judgement. Most people aren’t doctors though and they dont think or even care how it affects us, but really the doctors need more legal protection than what we currently have. We can lose our livelihood any day despite having perfect judgement with prescriptions.",阿片類藥物危機是什麼？,我從事醫療保健工作。阿片類藥物危機是在美國的這種情況，可以看出，提供者在開處方的規定比應有的方式更加自由。有幾項研究表明，這些阿片類藥物會令人上癮，而無辜的人可以在手術後的簡單5-7天劑量上癮。外行人沒有意識到的問題是醫學已成為患者滿意度行業。如果我對病人的壓力寫阿片類藥物，我知道我將遇到麻煩。當我拒絕給他們我認為沒有表明的阿片類藥物時，他們更有可能不滿意，並有可能將我告上法庭。現在這就是樂趣開始的地方。他們可能會因為“不同情幫助他們減輕我有能力的痛苦”而贏得對我的訴訟”。另一方面，如果我開了阿片類藥物，我可能會被起訴，因為它們會上癮。老實說，即使有完美的醫療判斷，也無法獲勝。雖然大多數人不是醫生，但他們不認為甚至不在乎它如何影響我們，但實際上，醫生需要比我們目前擁有的更大的法律保護。儘管對處方有完美的判斷，但我們每天都會失去生計。

Why are cops in the US allowed to break into your house without a warrant when there's a party?,"They aren't. They do not have the lawful authority to break into *any* private structure, business or residential, in the absence of something called *exigent circumstances.* Basically, an exigent circumstance is any situation in which *not* acting creates an unreasonable risk of harm to something or somebody. If a policeman were walking down the street and heard cries of ""Help! Help!"" coming from within a private residence, that policeman would have the lawful authority to make entry to that residence, up to and including breaking the door in. That's because under that circumstance, the policeman would reasonably suspect that somebody was *actively coming to harm* in the residence at that time, and that waiting could cause that person to come to still greater harm. But a noise complaint does not create an exigent circumstance. If somebody calls in a noise complaint on you, the police will come to your house, knock on the door, and *ask* to be invited inside so they can check things out. They will not break your door in, because there's no reason to believe it's an exigent circumstance. However, there is also the matter of what's called *probable cause.* Probable cause is the legal doctrine that says sometimes peace officers — policemen, sheriffs and so on —\xa0have the lawful authority to conduct an arrest or a search right there on the spur of the moment, without getting explicit judicial approval . If a policeman comes to your door in response to a noise complaint, looks past you into your residence and *sees people snorting white powder,* that policeman will have the lawful authority to enter your home with or without permission and determine whether that white powder is a controlled substance. So the short answer to your question is that police cannot break into your home except under exigent circumstances, and they can't even enter your home without permission without probable cause, and a noise complaint *by itself* creates neither.",為什麼在聚會時允許美國警察闖入您的房屋而沒有逮捕令？,他們不是。他們沒有合法的權力來闖入 *在沒有某種稱為“緊急情況的事物”的情況下闖入 *任何 *私人結構，商業或住宅。對某物或某人的傷害。如果一名警察在街上走來走去，聽到“幫助！救助！”的哭聲。從私人住所內到達，該警察將有合法的權力進入該住所，直至並包括闖入。在當時的住所中，等待可能會導致該人受到更大的傷害。但是噪音投訴並沒有造成緊急情況。如果有人向您提出噪音投訴，警察將來到您的房子，敲門，請 *要求 *被邀請在裡面，以便他們可以檢查一下。他們不會打破您的門，因為沒有理由相信這是一種緊急情況。但是，還有一個可能的原因。刺激了當下，而沒有得到明確的司法批准。如果警察響應噪音投訴來到您的門口，請過您進入您的住所， *看到人們嗅著白色的粉末， *警察將有合法的權力在未經許可的情況下進入您的家，並確定該白色粉末是否是一種受控物質。因此，對您的問題的簡短答案是，除了在緊急情況下，警察不能闖入您的家，而且如果沒有可能的原因，他們甚至無法在未經許可的情況下進入您的房屋，而噪音投訴 *本身也不會產生。
The reasoning behind Mormon polygamy.,"For what it's worth, here's [the Church's official explanation]. Consider the source, obviously, but you sometimes see claims of one official reason or another and this is the only real official answer I suspect you'll find.Short answer: Joseph Smith wanted to have multiple wives and he was in the position where he had people believing that he spoke for god.* Polygamy started as a cover story for the founder's sexual appetite.^[1] * Once Joseph Smith's secret was out of the bag, a lot of mormon men wanted a piece of the action. Smith had framed polygamy as being required to achieve the highest level of heaven.^[2] A lot of mormon men wanted to maximize their chances for *pussy* both now and in the hereafter! * A lot of mormon men thought a having a variety of young women around them not only brought a great variety to their sexual relationships, but they claimed that multiple partners had quantifiable advantages over monogamy. They claimed plural marriage helped stave off temptation from the illicit and immoral outlets of prostitution and adultery. Quotes available upon request. * Because one of the stated goals was to raise up a righteous generation of mormons, birth control was *out of the question.* Also, women past menopause were summarily jettisoned and discarded.^[3] The polygamist branches of mormonism continue to reward their older men with the youngest and most fertile hens. * It probably goes with out saying, but please disregard the lingering misogyny. It is simply a figment of your imagination. ;) ELI5: Partriarchy wins out over matriarchy.

Why is haggling something that just doesn't happen any more?,"Market efficiency in action. Used to be if I wanted to buy something, I didn't have a lot of choices. There were no supermarkets or shopping malls, and I was pretty much stuck with wherever I was willing to walk to. If a seller was charging more than I wanted to pay, I couldn't just go somewhere else. Luckily, the seller was stuck with me too. If they wanted to make a sale, they might not be able to count on a bunch of other people walking through the door. The only real alternative either of us had for getting a better price was to argue about it. In addition, a lot of sellers were selling goods they made themselves, which gave them some flexibility. If you are selling something for $10 and paid $8 wholesale, you rarely will sell it for less than that. But if you paid $1 for materials and put an hour of your time into it, you still might want to sell it for $10, but selling it for $5 isn't losing money.",為什麼討價還價的事情不再發生？,市場效率的行動效率。過去，如果我想買東西，我沒有很多選擇。沒有超級市場或購物中心，無論我願意走到哪裡，我都會堅持下去。如果賣方收取的費用超過了我想要的費用，我不能只去其他地方。幸運的是，賣家也被我困住了。如果他們想進行銷售，他們可能無法依靠許多其他人走過門。我們唯一真正的替代方案就是要獲得更好的價格。此外，許多賣家正在出售自己製造的商品，這給了他們一些靈活性。如果您以10美元的價格出售商品並批發8美元，那麼您很少會以低於此價格出售。但是，如果您花了1美元購買材料並將一小時的時間投入其中，您仍然可能想以10美元的價格出售它，但以5美元的價格出售它不會虧錢。
Why are computer and calculator number pads in the opposite order of phone keypads?,"The original calculator had a 1x9 column of number buttons for each digit, with 1 at the bottom and 9 at the top.

When calculator people figured you could use one ""5"" key if you did numbers in order with a ""0"" key, they folded the 1x9 up into a 3x3 grid with a ""0"" below it. At that time, phone dials were rotary. Bell did a huge experiment with both formats, but only a very small fraction of society had ever used a calculator . They decided on the 3x4 grid with ""1 2 3"" at the top because that was the pad that most people used most quickly/correctly.

The biggest difference though: The F-14 came about during the Cold War; the USSR was a real threat to the US, the F-14 represented aerial supremacy for the US, compounded by media representation such as Top Gun.

Just over 200 years ago, being obese to morbidly obese was considered very attractive, because it meant their family was wealthy and could afford to eat enough to make them fat, which was an uncommon thing at the time. It isnt even a conscious effort, our subconscious breaks down the subtle meanings and gives us either positive or negative feedback. These days, when someone is obese or morbidly obese , it no longer means they are incredibly wealthy, so we do not find it attractive. On the contrary, it typically shows that they lack discipline, have difficulty setting long term goals, and struggle controlling their impulses, all traits that would effect a partner negativley when trying to reproduce and raise offspring. The mind is a fascinating thing.Attractiveness is an evolutionary tool to discriminate mates with better genes. Facial symmetry, which is generally seen as more attractive is one indicator of good genes. Genes that I wouldn't mind mingling with my own.I read an article years ago in what was probably Discover Magazine, based on my recollection of my reading habits at the time, suggesting ties between attractive traits and reproductive fitness. A ""strong jaw"" in men is the product of testosterone, the""manly"" hormone, and it suggests he will be a good provider. A certain hip-to-waist ratio in women is considered good ""birthing hips"" across cultures, even in Amazon tribes with no exposure to outside media. We are hardwired by evolution to favor traits that indicate our partners are healthy, will help us provide for ourselves, and will help us raise children who will themselves be reproductively successfulBeyond the biological reasons that others have outlined, many standards of beauty are cultural. So people that have whatever those traits may be are going to be seen as beautiful by the bulk of the population.",是什麼使某些人通常認為比其他人更具吸引力？,它只是進化的工具。我們被編程為尋找最佳伴侶來繁殖，而且我們不僅可以從外觀上進行物理屬性。就在200多年前，肥胖對病態肥胖被認為是非常有吸引力的，因為這意味著他們的家人很富有，有能力吃得足以讓他們脂肪，這在當時很不常見。這甚至不是有意識的努力，我們的潛意識破壞了微妙的含義，並給了我們正面或負面的反饋。如今，當某人肥胖或病態肥胖時，這不再意味著他們非常富有，因此我們認為它沒有吸引力。相反，通常表明他們缺乏紀律，難以設定長期目標，並難以控制自己的衝動，所有這些特徵在試圖複製和提高後代時會影響伴侶Negativley。頭腦是一件令人著迷的事情。吸引力是一種進化工具，可以歧視具有更好基因的伴侶。面部對稱性通常被視為更具吸引力是良好基因的指標。我不介意與自己的融合的基因。幾年前，我在《發現》雜誌上讀了一篇文章，基於我當時對閱讀習慣的回憶，暗示著有吸引力的特徵與生殖健身之間的聯繫。男性“強壯的下巴”是睾丸激素，即“男子氣概”激素的產物，這表明他將成為一個好的提供者。即使在沒有暴露於外部媒體的亞馬遜部落中，女性的某種髖關節比率也被認為是跨文化的良好“分娩臀部”。進化方面的努力使我們偏愛表明我們的伴侶健康，將幫助我們為自己提供的特徵，並將幫助我們撫養他們將在生殖中取得成功的兒童，而他人概述了其他人所概述的生物學原因，許多美的標準是文化的。因此，擁有這些特徵的人可能會被大部分人口視為美麗。
Can a piece of toilet paper absorb the same amount of water after a cycle of wet-dry-wet?,"Probably not. Toilet paper is designed to break up in water. I would expect the gaps in the fibers, the gaps that hold the water, would collapse as it soaks, leaving less volume for water retention after drying out.",濕潤濕週期後，一張廁紙可以吸收相同數量的水嗎？,可能不是。衛生紙旨在在水中分解。我希望纖維中的縫隙，含水的縫隙會隨著浸泡而崩潰，在乾燥後留下的水量較少。
