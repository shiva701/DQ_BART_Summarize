Why do you get chills/goosebumps from hearing large crowds sing along to songs?,"I think it's because, at that moment, it's basically a large number of people all of the same mind and thinking and saying the same thing, which is an astonishing thing if you think about it. As a performing musician myself, the biggest rush I get on stage is when people start singing along to the song and, after the initial mismatch in their tempo and volume, they all synchronize and the whole place resonates. That feeling of collective output is an amazing feeling and it really gives you a strong sense of fraternity and belonging, knowing that all the people around you are passionate about the same thing. If that's not enough to give a person goosebumps, I'm not sure what is.",為什麼聽到大批人唱歌到歌曲中，您會感到寒意/雞皮嗎？,我認為這是因為，在那一刻，基本上是許多人的思想，思考和說同一件事，如果您想到的話，這是一件令人驚訝的事情。作為自己的表演音樂家，我在舞台上最大的匆忙是人們開始唱歌，而在最初的速度和音量不匹配之後，他們都同步了，整個地方都會引起共鳴。這種集體輸出的感覺是一種令人驚嘆的感覺，它確實使您有著強烈的兄弟情誼和歸屬感，因為他們知道您周圍的所有人都對同一件事充滿熱情。如果這還不足以給一個人雞皮s，我不確定是什麼。
"What's the difference between a bush, a shrub, and a tree?","Shrubs and trees are both specifically *woody* plants with stems that survive throughput the winter. A tree has a clear central trunk whereas a shrub has multiple stems rising from the ground. 'Bush' is a more general term for any plant with multiple stems rising from the ground, and that can be either woody or what's called herbaceous, herbaceous plants are ones where the stems die back completely or substantially in the winter leaving the plant with just its roots and new stems grow next spring.",灌木叢，灌木和一棵樹有什麼區別？,灌木和樹木都是特有的 *木質 *植物，莖可在冬季生存。一棵樹有一個清晰的中央軀幹，而灌木的多個莖從地面升起。對於任何具有多個莖從地面上升的植物來說它的根和新莖在明年春天生長。
Why is it hard to breathe with a strong air gust blowing straight at your face?,"Moving air = lower pressure. The greater the difference in pressure between your lungs and the outside air, the easier it is to breatheIt's caused by something called a ""Laryngospasm"" basically, the strong air triggers the gag reflex because the back of your throat thinks there is fluid going down your lungs. It's a false triggering, because the pressure from the strong gusts of air is high enough to ""feel"" like a liquid. the Epiglottis slams shut preventing the fluid from entering your lungs. Cold air causes this reaction as well.",為什麼很難用強烈的空氣吹到臉上呼吸？,移動空氣=較低的壓力。您的肺部和外部空氣之間的壓力差異越大，呼吸越容易由稱為“喉部”的東西引起的呼吸，強烈的空氣會觸發堵塞的反射肺。這是一個虛假的觸發，因為強烈的空氣陣風的壓力足以像液體一樣“感覺”。Epiglottis猛擊關閉，以防止液體進入您的肺部。冷空氣也會引起這種反應。
how having hereditary cancer genes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get cancer? How can you not get cancer if you have these genes?,"It's kind of like a ""3 strikes and you're out"" thing. Someone who inherited these genes is born with one or two strikes. Another mutation during their lifetime could cause cancer.",遺傳性癌症基因並不一定意味著您會患癌症？如果您有這些基因，怎麼不能患癌症？,這有點像“ 3次罷工，你是出去”的東西。繼承這些基因的人天生有一兩個罷工。他們一生中的另一個突變可能導致癌症。
Why is the Super Bowl played on Sunday night rather than Saturday night?,"NFL Spokesman Brian McCarthy: ""The concept of playing the Super Bowl on a Sunday has worked well for 44 years and we don't anticipate moving away from this tradition. Fans expect to see the Super Bowl on a Sunday, the day on which 89.2 percent of NFL games are played.""The NFL plays on Sunday, college football plays on Saturday, high school football is played on Friday.",為什麼超級碗在周日晚上而不是星期六晚上演奏？,NFL發言人布萊恩·麥卡錫（Brian McCarthy）：“週日打超級碗的概念已經有44年了，我們預計不會擺脫這一傳統。球迷們希望在周日看到超級碗，這是89.2的那一天NFL比賽中的百分比是。
"Why do we use a different letter ""a"" when typing as opposed to when writing?","Cursive was invented because back in the day, people used ink quills. Cursive's function was to minimize the amount of times you had to raise your quill because of ink dropping on paper. Actual fonts on typewriters were designed so they would be more legible at quick glances.I write my a just like it appears on computersThe printed version is difficult to draw and people are lazy so they use the simple one. The fancy version is actually better as it won't be mixed up with ""o"" if the handwriting is poorI actually write all my ""a"" letters just like it would be typed. I began this when I was young and it stuck. It's all about what you teach yourself and use consistently. It feels weird at first but over time it becomes habit. Normally I write in all capital letters because i have fantastic handwriting and capital letters stand out. It makes what I write more noticeable, cleaner looking, and different from others. It has served me extremely well with getting job interviews and the like. My handwriting always comes up very early in the conversation as something that really brought the application etc to their attention. But if I am writing in lowercase which is incredibly rare, I still use the typed ""a"", which also stands outI saw a kid making the ""a"" like in a book when I was in 12th grade.I immediately adopted that style of a and really like doing it that wayfont? Different fonts would have different types of letters..",為什麼在打字時使用不同的字母“ A”而不是寫作時？,草書之所以發明，是因為當天，人們使用了墨水羽毛筆。草書的功能是最大程度地減少由於紙上墨水掉落而必須提高羽毛筆的次數。打字機上的實際字體是設計的，因此它們在快速瀏覽中更加清晰。我寫了我，就像在計算機上出現的印刷版本很難繪製，人們很懶惰，因此他們使用了簡單的版本。精美的版本實際上更好，因為如果筆跡是可憐的，它實際上寫下了我所有的“ A”字母，就像將其鍵入一樣。我年輕的時候就開始了。這全都與您自學並始終如一地使用有關。起初感覺很奇怪，但是隨著時間的流逝，它變得習慣了。通常，我寫所有大寫字母，因為我的筆跡很棒，大寫字母脫穎而出。它使我寫的內容更加明顯，更清潔，並且與其他人不同。它在獲得求職面試之類的情況下為我提供了很好的服務。我的筆跡總是很早就出現在談話的早期，因為這確實引起了他們的注意。但是，如果我寫的小寫字母非常罕見，我仍然使用鍵入的“ A”，這也是我12年級時的一本書中的孩子，就像一本書一樣。我立即採用了這種風格一個，真的很喜歡這樣做嗎？不同的字體將具有不同類型的字母。

What is the differences between airplanes and jets,"All jets are airplanes, not all airplanes are jets. Airplane is a broad term for a heavier than air flying vehicle with fixed wings. A jet is an airplane that utilizes jet engines.A jet is any airplane that's powered by a gas turbine, *and* lacks a propeller. The most basic type of jet engine, called a turbojet, sucks in air and uses a series of blades to compress it as it heads into the combustion chamber. It's then mixed with fuel and ignited. It passes through a turbine driving the compressor. Then the high speed exhaust provides thrust for the aircraft. Most modern jet aircraft use something called a turbofan. You basically take a turbojet and strap a huge fan on the front of it. The jet part drives the fan and provides hot air thrust. The fan provides cold air thrust. These are more efficient and quieter than pure turbojets at sub-sonic speeds. Prop planes are any airplanes driven by a propeller. These can be powered by a gas turbine as well, called a turboprop. It works the same as a turbofan, just replaces the fan with a geared propeller.",飛機和噴氣機之間有什麼區別,所有噴氣式飛機都是飛機，並非所有飛機都是噴氣式飛機。飛機比帶有固定機翼的飛行器更重的術語。噴氣式飛機是使用噴氣發動機的飛機。一架飛機是由燃氣輪機供電的任何飛機， *和 *缺少螺旋槳。最基本的噴氣發動機類型稱為渦輪噴氣機，吸入空氣中，並使用一系列葉片將其壓縮到燃燒室時。然後將其與燃料混合併點燃。它通過駕駛壓縮機的渦輪機。然後，高速排氣為飛機提供了推力。大多數現代的噴氣飛機都使用稱為渦輪扇的東西。基本上，您可以拿一個渦輪噴氣機，並在其前面綁著一個巨大的風扇。噴氣部件驅動風扇並提供熱氣推力。風扇提供冷空氣推力。這些比以下速度更高效，更安靜。道具飛機是由螺旋槳驅動的任何飛機。這些也可以由燃氣輪機供電，稱為渦輪螺旋槳飛機。它的工作原理與渦輪大豆相同，只需用齒輪螺旋槳代替風扇即可。
"How internet speeds work, megabits vs megabytes, download vs. upload etc.",Upload speed is exactly what you said: the speed at which you can upload. A megabyte is just 8 megabits so divide your advertised speed by 8 and that's how many megabytes you can up/download per second.,互聯網速度如何工作，Megabits vs Megabytes，下載與上傳等。,上傳速度正是您所說的：您可以上傳的速度。Megabyte只有8兆位，因此將您的廣告速度除以8，這就是您可以上下/下載的兆字節。
"Why are coupons valued at ""1/100 of 1 cent""?","Prior to the 1900's there were these things called catalogue stores, or company stores, and they'd give you these little stamps with each purchase. If you saved up enough stamps you would be able to redeem them for items from the store, like the prize tickets at Chuck E Cheese. In the early 1900's New York passed laws that forced these stores to allow people to redeem the stamps for cash. As such, these stamps would now have face values. Other states followed suit and some of these states did not differentiate between stamps and coupons. So coupons now have face values because it is easier for the store to print one coupon type that works around the nation than to do different ones for each state to satisfy their laws.",為什麼優惠券價值為“ 1美分的1/100”？,在1900年代之前，有這些東西稱為目錄商店或公司商店，每次購買時，它們都會為您提供這些小郵票。如果您保存了足夠的郵票，您將可以從商店中兌換商品，例如Chuck E Cheese的獎金。在1900年代初期，紐約通過了法律，該法律迫使這些商店允許人們兌換郵票以現金。因此，這些郵票現在將具有面值。其他州也效仿，其中一些州沒有區分郵票和優惠券。因此，優惠券現在具有面部價值，因為商店更容易打印一種在全國范圍內運行的優惠券類型，而不是為每個州做不同的法律。
Why does my dog roll in poop?,"Poop is actually really exciting for dogs specifically because it's scent is so potent. They don't care that they will be covered in poop because dogs do not have a negative thought associated with their own or others' excrement, unlike humans. Dogs don't really have social boundaries. This is also why they smell each other's butts and genitalia.",為什麼我的狗在大便？,對於狗來說，實際上，大便真的很令人興奮，因為它的氣味是如此有效。他們不在乎他們會被大便覆蓋，因為與人類不同，狗沒有與自己或他人的糞便相關的負面思想。狗真的沒有社會界限。這也是為什麼他們聞到彼此的屁股和生殖器的原因。
Why do the high pitch sound-effects used in horror movies make the scene appear a lot more scarier than it really is?,"Because it is ''biologically code'' in our brains to react to high sounds. They may after all either be a predator coming for us, or someone of our species being in danger. It's a survival instinct. Same thing with the fear for spiders.",為什麼在恐怖電影中使用的高音調聲音效果使場景看起來比實際要多得多？,因為我們的大腦中是“生物學上的編碼”，以對高聲音做出反應。畢竟，他們可能是我們的捕食者，或者我們物種處於危險之中的人。這是一種生存本能。對蜘蛛的恐懼也是如此。
How is the government legally allowed to hide a bill within a larger bill?,"They don't ""hide"" it exactly. They write whatever they want. If a bill is mostly about something critical like the budget they can add paragraphs about anything else - I think this one has a few lines that prohibit the Sage Grouse from ever being on the endagered species list for any reason. Legislators have to vote up or down on the whole thing after all the wrangling has been done. So if enough legislators want to pass the major premise despite the extraneous stuff they vote for it. When a bill is multiple thousands of pages, obviously very few people have read it all before hand - hence the descriptions of stuff being ""hidden"".",政府如何合法地將賬單隱藏在更大的賬單中？,他們不准確地“隱藏”它。他們寫自己想要的東西。如果一項法案主要涉及像預算這樣的關鍵的事情，他們可以添加有關其他任何內容的段落 - 我認為這有幾行，禁止鼠尾草松雞出於任何原因而禁止鼠尾草列表。在所有爭吵完成後，立法者必須對整個事情進行投票。因此，如果足夠多的立法者想通過主要的前提，他們投票贊成。當賬單是數千頁時，顯然很少有人在手上閱讀所有內容 - 因此，對東西的描述被“隱藏”。
how is the wifi on an airplane able to identify and block VoIP calls? Isn't it just data whether it's a video clip or voice?,"VOIP traffic uses a special port, in-flight wifi blocks that port.

What stops countries printing their own currency for their government to pay off foreign debt?,"> But I don't understand what stops governments creating money if they need to. Nothing stops them, they can do that if they need to. But creating money doesn't create wealth, so making more money makes all the money out there less valuable. If they do this a bunch you can get rampant inflation, so bagels cost trillions of dollars for example.This question gets asked a surprising amount of times. Try searching for it before you post.Hyperinflation. See Zimbabwe, where they're up to like quintillion dollar bills or something ridiculous like that.",是什麼阻止國家打印自己的貨幣供政府償還外債？,>但是，我不明白是什麼阻止政府創造金錢的話。沒有什麼可以阻止他們，如果需要的話，他們可以做到這一點。但是創造金錢並不能創造財富，因此賺更多的錢會使所有資金的價值不那麼寶貴。如果他們這樣做，您可能會得到猖ramp的通貨膨脹，所以百吉餅要花費數万億美元。這個問題被問到了令人驚訝的次數。在發布之前，請嘗試搜索它。參見津巴布韋，在那裡他們喜歡Quintillion賬單或類似的荒謬賬單。
what happened at tiananmen square and why?,"Back in 1989 a bunch of college aged Chinese students began to protest in the square. They wanted democratic government reforms and more individual liberties. The Chinese government didn't appreciate it very much so they declared martial law and sent the military in to break up the protests. Reliable numbers aren't readily available, because it isn't the kind of thing China wanted to advertise, but estimates of the number of Chinese civilians killed ranges from the hundreds to the thousands, and casualties from the thousands to the 10s of thousands. Edit: It also made [this] anonymous guy world famous.There was a massacre of protesters by the Chinese army. It started with a local student protest for reform. The protest attracted more support and grew. The government responded by declaring martial law, and bringing in army units to disperse the protesters by force, using tanks and automatic weapons.",天安門廣場發生了什麼事，為什麼？,早在1989年，一群大學老年學生就開始在廣場上抗議。他們希望民主政府的改革和更多的個人自由。中國政府對此並不欣賞，因此他們宣布戒嚴，並派軍隊打破了抗議活動。可靠的數字不容易獲得，因為這不是中國想要做廣告的那種東西，但是估計中國平民的數量從數百到成千上萬的範圍以及從成千上萬到十萬人的傷亡。編輯：這也使[這個]匿名的傢伙著名。它始於當地的學生抗議改革。抗議活動吸引了更多的支持並增長。政府通過宣布戒嚴令，並使用坦克和自動武器武力地驅散抗議者。
Why is snow white when water and ice are clear?,"Snow is formed by very small ice crystals, which reflect sun light in all directions. Since sunlight is white it seems white. The same happens to sugar and salt. They're both clear, but look white.",當水和冰透明時，為什麼白雪公主會變白？,雪是由非常小的冰晶形成的，這些冰晶在各個方向都反映了陽光。由於陽光是白色的，它似乎是白色的。糖和鹽也是如此。他們倆都很清楚，但看起來是白色的。

Why does my cat ignore me when I say its name but it always looks up when I make a kissy noise?,"I've worked with cats for years. Your cat knows his/her name. He/She simply does not associate anything that he enjoys with you calling him by name. Since there is no benefit in it for your cat, he doesn't respond to his name when you say it. The kissy noise might be associated, in his mind, with a bird or other critter -- or perhaps you give him a treat when you make the kissy noise.",當我說出名字時，為什麼我的貓會忽略我，但是當我發出吻的聲音時總是抬頭？,我已經與貓一起工作了多年。你的貓知道他/她的名字。他/她根本不將他喜歡的任何東西都與他打電話給他。由於它對您的貓沒有好處，因此當您說出它時，他不會回應他的名字。在他的腦海中，接吻的聲音可能與鳥或其他小動物相關聯 - 或者當您發出親吻的聲音時，您也許會給他一個善良。
"What are the differences between direct, representative, and parliamentary democracies?",Direct democracies are ruled by literally having everybody give input on everything. A representation democracy allows sub-groups of the whole to choose someone to represent them and that representative works within some government body to work the will of the people they represent. A parliamentary democracy generally means a Westminster style parliament which is a specific model for a representative democracy.,直接，代表和議會民主國家之間有什麼區別？,直接民主國家的統治是從字面上讓每個人都對一切都發表意見。代表民主使整體的子群體可以選擇某人代表他們，而代表在某些政府機構內部工作，以努力工作他們所代表的人的意願。議會民主通常意味著威斯敏斯特風格的議會，這是代表民主的特定模式。
Why can’t you buy antibiotics over the counter in the United States?,"you cant in the uk either. its the countrys that are selling them over the counter thats the issue. the more we use them the quicker an immunity is being built against them. they should be saved for cases where antibiotics is needed, and that should be the opinion of a doctorThe choice to use antibiotics depends on various factors like the type of bacteria will be targeted, which organs are affected, how long you need to treat and is a resistant bacteria present. Allowing people to purchase antibiotics over the counter will lead to gross overuse and the rise of resistance , meaning the bacteria will become less responsive to the antibiotics and eventually will need another, stronger type of antibiotic to treat it. By the way, you do not need an antibiotic for the sniffles. Also, not every antibiotic will take care of every type of infection. The average person cannot be left to make a decision on which antibiotic to buy. What if it does not work? What if it interacts with your other medications? Also, when do you decide that you do need an antibiotic. Leaving such a big decision with serious consequences to the average lay person to make is a terrible idea.",您為什麼不能在美國的櫃檯上購買抗生素？,您也不能在英國。它的國家在櫃檯上出售它們，這就是問題。我們使用它們越多，對它們建立免疫力就越快。應將它們保存在需要抗生素的情況下，這應該是醫生的觀點，選擇使用抗生素取決於各種因素，例如將細菌的類型靶向，受影響的器官，您需要治療多長時間存在抗性細菌。允許人們在櫃檯上購買抗生素會導致過度使用和抗藥性的興起，這意味著細菌對抗生素的反應較低，最終將需要另一種更強大的抗生素來治療它。順便說一句，您不需要嗅探的抗生素。同樣，並非每種抗生素都會照顧每種類型的感染。普通人不能決定購買哪種抗生素。如果它不起作用怎麼辦？如果它與其他藥物互動怎麼辦？另外，您什麼時候決定需要一種抗生素。給普通外行人做出的重大決定留下了一個巨大的決定，這是一個可怕的主意。
What is going on with the human body during Sleep Paralysis?,"When sleeping, the brain releases a chemical that prevents the body from moving, so that actions taken in dreams will not cause you to for example, lash out your arm and break it against something. Sometimes, you come to Consciousness before the brain releases the chemical required to enable movements. That's all that's really happening during sleep paralysis. Signals from the brain to move the body are unable to go because they're being blocked by the chemical.",睡眠癱瘓期間人體發生了什麼？,睡覺時，大腦會釋放一種可防止身體移動的化學物質，因此在夢中採取的動作不會使您猛烈抨擊手臂並將其折斷。有時，您會意識到大腦釋放實現運動所需的化學物質。這就是睡眠麻痺期間真正發生的一切。從大腦移動身體的信號由於被化學物質阻塞而無法移動。

When air is forced through a constricted area, it will vibrate when it hits a surface .",吹口哨時我的嘴裡發生了什麼？,您正在將空氣推到嘴唇上，嘴唇的形狀在過去時振動空氣。當空氣通過狹窄的區域強迫時，它會撞擊表面時會振動。
How is the motherboard able to regulate voltage digitally?,"There are a few ways that regulation can work digitally. I'll go over two below: ###PWMPWM, or Pulse Width Modulation, makes the assumption that the average voltage over a wire is just as good as any instantaneous voltage. The voltage is switched on and off really fast and the duty cycle, or percentage of the time the voltage is on, multiplied by the peak voltage is equivalent to the average voltage over a wire. ###Resistor LaddersResistor ladders are how digital to analog converters work along with analog video signals such as VGA. The same voltage is fed into a bunch of resistors, each individual resistor's source controlled by a digital logic. The voltage out of each resistor added up is equivalent to the output voltage. The advantage of this technique is that it does not rely on average voltage but rather the instantaneous voltage. It is, however, limited in resolution by the size of the resistor ladder whereas PWM is limited by a timer on a microprocessor.",主板如何以數字方式調節電壓？,法規可以通過幾種方式進行數字工作。我將在下面瀏覽兩個：### PWMPWM或脈衝寬度調製，假設電線上的平均電壓與任何瞬時電壓一樣好。電壓的打開和關閉非常快，佔空比，或電壓打開的時間百分比，乘以峰值電壓等於電線上平均電壓。###電阻階梯式梯子是數字到模擬轉換器以及模擬視頻信號（例如VGA）的工作方式。相同的電壓被饋入一堆電阻器，每個電阻器的源由數字邏輯控制。每個電阻的電壓加起來等同於輸出電壓。該技術的優點是它不依賴平均電壓，而是瞬時電壓。但是，它的分辨率限制在電阻梯的大小上，而PWM受到微處理器上的計時器的限制。
Is it possible for a shape or object to lack any positions where it can be balanced?,Everything with mass has a centre of gravity on which it can be balanced. Some shapes are harder than others but that point still exists no matter how infinitesimally small.,形狀或物體是否有可能缺乏可以平衡的位置？,質量的一切都有一個可以平衡的重心。有些形狀比其他形狀更難，但是無論多麼微小，這一點仍然存在。
"How are military documentaries, which include deployment footage interviews, made?","Aside from being someone in the military with the ""Press Corp"" i.e. a *military* cameraman/reporter here for propoganda purposes, actually, there is such a thing as ""embedded war reporter"" where a typical journalist will be given permission to travel alongside combat units to run stories on them. Effectively, like civillians in combat. They are issued some basic gear to help them around e.g. kevlar vests, but no weapons and for the most part they are instructed to seek cover whenever the convoy/unit is fired upon and stay out of trouble. They travel and fly and follow everything else the unit. In the past, they pretty much took a risk and just went ahead to war zones, courtesy of their press company. I think nowadays, the Defence Department however will give permits for these and hence issue them with basic protections, and the right to be ""embedded"" as part of the unit. Depending on the war, some funding may be given by the Department as part of PR and propoganda efforts; however for the most part the reporters are self-funded or press-funded, and draw a salary like other normal reporters from their press companyWe had a military photographer attached to our unit. He was a soldier, just carried a camera with him all the time. I remember him video taping quite a bit as well.",如何製作包括部署錄像訪談在內的軍事紀錄片如何？,除了與“新聞集團”一起參加軍隊之外，即在這里為了宣傳目的，在這裡 *軍事 *攝影師/記者，實際上，還有一件事情，例如“嵌入式戰爭記者”，典型的記者將獲得同意的許可戰鬥部隊在他們身上播放故事。有效，就像戰鬥中的公民一樣。他們獲得了一些基本的裝備，以幫助他們圍繞。凱夫拉爾背心，但沒有武器，在大多數情況下，他們被指示在車隊/部隊被開除並擺脫麻煩時尋求掩護。他們旅行並飛行，並遵循其他所有設備。過去，他們幾乎冒險了，剛剛由他們的新聞公司提供了戰區。我認為如今，國防部將授予這些許可，因此將其提供基本保護，並有權作為該部門的一部分“嵌入”。根據戰爭的不同，部門可以作為公關和宣傳工作的一部分提供一些資金；但是，在大多數情況下，記者是自籌資金或新聞資助的，並像他們的新聞界的其他常規記者一樣，賺取工資，我們的部隊有一名軍事攝影師。他是一名士兵，一直隨身攜帶一台相機。我記得他的錄像帶也很多。
How can countries owe themselves money?,"[This] explains it pretty well and in depth. But to sum it up very shortly - Different government departments may, on occasion, have more money than they need to spend that year. The money left over is then invested in government bonds. Through this system, the government is both creditor and debtor - it is just two different departmentsYou also have to watch what they are specifically saying. A large portion of a country's debt can be owned by it's citizens. Meaning that in a country ""run by the people"" like a democracy or republic, the country owes itself money by owing it's citizens.",國家如何欠自己的錢？,[這個]很好地解釋了它。但是要概括很快 - 有時，不同的政府部門可能會擁有比他們那一年所需的錢更多的錢。然後剩下的錢投資於政府債券。通過該系統，政府既是債權人又是債務人 - 您也只需要觀察他們的專門說法。一個國家債務的很大一部分可以由其公民擁有。這意味著，在一個像民主或共和國這樣“由人民經營的國家”中，該國欠該國的錢。
Why is it impressive that Google can now win at the game of Go?,"For decades, GO has been the go to example of a game that computers suck at. I remember discussing it in CS classes when talking about chess playing computers. While I don't remember the rules of the game, its supposed to be a game that is simple for the human mind, but mathematically extremely complex and difficult to turn into computer code, given the rules and strategy of the game. The fact that Google has built an AI that can play is a pretty big step in the direction of machine learning, which is itself a step in the direction of actual AI systems.",為什麼Google現在可以在GO遊戲中獲勝會令人印象深刻？,幾十年來，GO一直是計算機吸引的遊戲的例子。我記得在談論國際象棋遊戲計算機時在CS課中討論它。雖然我不記得遊戲的規則，但它應該是一個對人類思想來說很簡單的遊戲，但鑑於遊戲的規則和策略，數學上非常複雜且難以將其轉變為計算機代碼。Google建立了可以玩的AI，這是朝機器學習方向邁出的很大一步，這本身就是朝實際AI系統的方向邁出的一步。

"The difference in prehistoric ages, and how we know which dinosaurs/species lived in each.","Most prehistoric periods are separated from each other by an extinction event or by some other significant development. For example, we define the Cretaceous period roughly by the development of flowering plants, and define the end of it with the extinction event that caused the death of the dinosaurs . We know which species lived in each period by dating the rock that they're found in. Rock that is lower down is older; the rock layers that formed above those layers is newer. We don't always have a clear way of saying how old one specific layer or fossil is, but we can at least say ""well, it's older than this, but newer than that.""",史前時代的差異，以及我們如何知道哪些恐龍/物種生活在每個人中。,大多數史前時期通過滅絕事件或其他一些重要的發展彼此分開。例如，我們通過開花植物的發展大致定義了白堊紀時期，並通過導致恐龍死亡的滅絕事件來定義其末端。我們知道每個時期都會通過發現它們發現的岩石來生存哪些物種。較低的岩石年齡較大。在這些層上方形成的岩石層是更新的。我們並不總是說出一個特定層或化石的年齡，但我們至少可以說：“好吧，它比這更古老，但比這還要新。”
Why do some truly oppose net neutrality?,"Net Nutrality means that all data must be treated equally, no exceptions. However some people don't want all of their data to be treated the same. For example, if you spend 95% of your time online on low-bandwidth websites like Reddit or email then it probably isn't worth it or you to pay for a super-fast connection. But if for the remaining 5% of the time you want to stream HD video from YouTube or Netflix then a slow connection just won't cut it. The ideal compromise in this case would be to pay for basic speeds to most sites and then pay extra so you can get high speed to your video sites, and overall the cost would be less than if you paid for high speeds to all sites. Of course there would still need to be proper regulations to ensure that ISPs don't abuse their position, either for profit or on competition grounds.",為什麼有些真正反對網絡中立？,淨營養性意味著所有數據必須平等處理，也不例外。但是，有些人不希望所有數據得到相同的處理。例如，如果您將95％的時間在網上花費在Reddit或Email等低型帶寬網站上，那麼這可能不值得，或者您要為超級快速的連接付費。但是，如果您想從YouTube或Netflix流式傳輸高清視頻，那麼慢速連接就不會削減它。在這種情況下，理想的妥協是為大多數網站支付基本速度，然後支付額外費用，以便您可以獲得高速的視頻網站，總體而言，成本將比您支付給所有網站的高速付費。當然，仍然需要有適當的法規，以確保為了利潤或競爭理由，ISP不會濫用其立場。
Why is putting a worm in alcohol a thing?,"Worms are only put into mezcal . Some makers claim it helps the flavor, but the effect is small if any.

"How do disc resurfacers work? I assume that scratches on a disc destroy data, so how does the machine restore said data?","Assuming you are talking about optical discs: the actual data is stored on the metallic looking layer embedded in the clear plastic material. Disc resurfacers repair scratches to the plastic part, not the metallic part. If the scratch is deep enough to reach the metallic part, the data is toast.The actual data is stored as a layer inside the material; on scratched discs it is not lost but just unreadable through the surface defects. The resurfacer just polishes out the scratches I think there's also some redundancy in how the data is arranged so even if minor defects remain the disc is readable.",光盤重新鋪面如何工作？我認為在光盤上的划痕破壞了數據，那麼機器還原如何說明數據？,假設您在談論光盤：實際數據存儲在嵌入透明塑料材料中的金屬外觀層上。光盤重新浮出水面修復塑料部分，而不是金屬部分。如果划痕足夠深，可以到達金屬部分，則數據是敬酒的。實際數據將作為材料內部的一層存儲；在刮擦的圓盤上，它不會丟失，而只是通過表面缺陷無法讀取。我認為，我認為數據的排列方式也有一些冗餘，因此即使次要缺陷仍然存在，光盤也是可讀的。
Why do truck stops sell freakishly large knives?,"Truckers spend a lot of time in not-so-great neighborhoods.I've gotten to know a few truckers in the last few years, and while I can't speak for all of them, I can speak for a few. One explanation I can offer is that some truck drivers get a refund on gas of a certain percentage. Some get the refund for using cash instead of credit, some may get it for using the truck stop's own fuel card. When the truck drivers get the cash, they are more likely to make an impulse purchase equal to the amount of the rebate. If the truck stop sells freakishly large knives, the knives go for a high price. The high price will be what the driver will pay since he has extra cash he wasn't counting on.",為什麼卡車停車賣出怪異的大刀？,卡車司機在不太悠久的社區里花了很多時間。在過去的幾年中，我已經認識了一些卡車司機，儘管我不能為所有人說話，但我可以說幾句話。我可以提供的一種解釋是，一些卡車司機會退款一定百分比的氣體。有些人獲得使用現金而不是信貸的退款，有些人可能會因為使用卡車停車自己的加油卡而獲得它。當卡車司機得到現金時，他們更有可能進行沖動的購買等於回扣金額。如果卡車停車銷售出奇特的大刀，那把刀以高昂的價格出售。高價將是駕駛員將要付出的錢，因為他有未指望的額外現金。

"When people commit suicide from jumping off of a bridge into the water, what kills them?","In1968, Snyder looked at autopsy reports from 169 people who had jumpedoff the Golden Gate Bridge. Eighty-five percent had broken ribs, whereasonly 15 percent emerged with fractured vertebrae and only a third witharm or leg fractures. Broken ribs are minor in and of themselves, butduring high-velocity impacts they become sharp, jagged weapons thatpierce and slice what lies within them: heart, lungs, aorta. In 76 percent ofthe cases Snyder and Snow looked at, the ribs had punctured the lungs.Statistics from Flight 800 sketched a similar scenario: Most of the bodiesdisplayed the telltale internal injuries of extreme water impact.

This doesn't happen when diving because the diver is going much slower and water has time to get ""out of the way"".an average human falls at the speed of 117-125mph and it takes 5-10 secs to reach that speed. That being said once the body hits the surface of the water it cannot displace at the same force/speed; this cause the water to act as a hard surface almost as hard as concrete.

How do photographers take photo's of the galaxy like in this photo?,"This looks to be a double exposure that has been meshed together. First you set up a tri-pod that is very stable and you use a remote to trigger the camera.

Why is chocolate milk considered to be a good recovery drink after working out?,"Milk is a good choice because of the protein and fat it contains. Chocolate milk is said to be good because the ad agency for the milk industry said it is. And more people like chocolate milk that regular milk "", 'Put simply, it has lots of the things your body needs. The three main ""macros"" are carbs, protein, and fat. We burn lots of carbs and some fat while exercising, and we need protein to rebuild our muscles afterward. [A serving of chocolate milk] has 26g of carbs, 8g of fat, and 8g of protein. Also, it's recommended to get simple carbs, like sugar, immediately after exercise. Most of the carbs in chocolate milk are sugar. When exercising, your body also uses up ""electrolytes"" -- the important ones include sodium, potassium, and calcium. Milk contains a significant amount of each of these and other electrolytes. As someone else pointed out, [whole milk] is also a good choice, as the main difference is that chocolate milk has more sugar, but chocolate tastes better and goes down easier for many people, and the extra sugar could be a good thing post-workoutAfter working out your body is depleted of sugars and in need of proteins to help repair worked muscles. Chocolate milk is very similar in nutrition to more expensive recovery drinks, has a good mix of sugar/protein/fat at a fraction of the cost.",鍛煉後為什麼認為巧克力牛奶是一種很好的恢復飲料？,牛奶是一個不錯的選擇，因為它含有蛋白質和脂肪。據說巧克力牛奶很好，因為牛奶行業的廣告代理商表示是。越來越多的人喜歡定期牛奶的巧克力牛奶”，簡而言之然後我們需要蛋白質來重建肌肉。[一份巧克力牛奶]有26克碳水化合物，8克脂肪和8克蛋白質。此外，建議在運動後立即獲得簡單的碳水化合物，例如糖。巧克力牛奶中的碳水化合物是糖。鍛煉時，您的身體還消耗了“電解質”  - 重要的包括鈉，鉀和鈣。牛奶包含大量的每個和其他電解質。正如其他人指出的那樣，[全牛奶]也是一個不錯的選擇，因為主要區別是巧克力牛奶含量更多，但是巧克力的味道更好，而且對於許多人來說更容易下降，而額外的糖可能是工作後的好東西耗盡了糖，需要蛋白質來幫助修復有效的肌肉。巧克力牛奶的營養與更昂貴的恢復飲料非常相似，糖/蛋白質/脂肪的成本很少。
How do the journalists in documentaries about drugs and illegal weapons stay out of trouble despite being involved?,"Involved in what? Filming a crime isn't illegal, and outside of a few specific cases people have no obligation to report crimes to the police.

why glasses lenses are clear yet they still cast a black shadow in direct sunlight,"Shadows exist where the amount of light in some space is significantly less then the space around it. That light doesn't have to be blocked by some opaque surface, though, it's enough that it simple be redirected. In the case of glasses, their purpose is to bend light, moving it from one point to another.

- What is the concept behind car manufacturers not standardizing which side the fuel cap is located?,"Car manufacturers have various reasons for where they are placed.

How can cops tell which car was speeding when there is a lot of traffic?,"I'm not an expert, but I do know that radar guns have at least two modes they can operate in - ""fastest signal"" and ""strongest signal"" . When you point a radar gun at a group of cars, it shoots out a radar beam and then gets bounces back from multiple cars in the group. If the radar gun is in ""fastest signal"" mode, it looks at all the responses it got and displays the highest speed. The officer can then look at the group of cars and see which one is travelling the fastest and know the speed of that car. If the gun is in ""strongest signal"" mode, it shows whichever return signal came back the strongest, this is usually the vehicle in the center of the radar gun's beam, or the closest vehicle to the unit, or the largest vehicle in the beam. By using both radar modes and visual cues, the officer can identify which vehicle he's tracking. For instance, if a small sports car is speeding and hiding on the far side of a large truck that is going the limit, the strongest signal will be the truck, but the fastest signal will be the sports car. It's not a simple point-and-shoot operation, but with training they can tell which car they are tracking relatively easily.",警察怎麼能說出很多交通何時超速行駛？,我不是專家，但我確實知道雷達槍至少具有兩種模式 - “最快的信號”和“最強信號”。當您將雷達槍指向一組汽車時，它會射出雷達梁，然後從組中的多輛汽車中彈回。如果雷達槍處於“最快的信號”模式，它將查看其獲得的所有響應，並顯示最高速度。然後，軍官可以看一下汽車組，看看哪個汽車運行最快，並且知道那輛車的速度。如果槍支處於“最強信號”模式，則顯示返回信號最強的返回信號，通常是雷達槍的橫梁中心的車輛，或距離設備最接近的車輛或梁中最大的車輛。通過使用雷達模式和視覺提示，該官員可以識別他跟踪的車輛。例如，如果一輛小型跑車正在超速行駛並躲在限制範圍的大卡車的另一側，則最強烈的信號將是卡車，但最快的信號將是跑車。這並不是一個簡單的刻痕操作，但是通過訓練，他們可以說出他們相對容易跟踪的汽車。
The United States relationship with Puerto Rico,"Puerto Rico has been an unincorporated territory of the USA since 1898 when it was taken from the Spanish after the Spanish-American war. It has a form of self government that is subject to the US government under a territorial clause. And even though it is not a sovereign nation, Puerto Rico's residents can't vote for the president or get representation within the government of the USA. Puerto Ricans are natural born American citizens. In fact, Puerto Rico has more American citizens than 22 states of the USA Their citizenship is identical to the citizenship of the rest of Americans and the limitations that Puerto Ricans have are a result of their residence. For example, a Puerto Rican can't vote for the president while he lives in Puerto Rico but he can vote if he moves to an incorporated territory. Also, a Puerto Rican can't be the president of the USA unless he has lived 14 years in incorporated territories of the USA. But these requirements also apply to non Puerto Rican Americans. According to the two last status referendums in the island less than 5% want independence and about 46% wants Puerto Rico to become a state. The rest of the population wants a relationship between Puerto Rico and the USA to exist but the nature of this relationship is not well defined. Being a US territory Puerto Rico uses US currency, the US postal service, and Puerto Ricans have American passports. Puerto Ricans don't pay federal taxes, are recipients of US welfare, and are participants of programs like the Social Security and Medicare. Puerto Ricans can join the US armed forces, were drafted in the past, and Puerto Rico had active US armed forces bases. And just about every federal regulation applies to the island. _URL_1_ _URL_3_ _URL_0_ _URL_2_ // I'll try to find you the PDF document that states that Puerto Ricans are natural born citizens later.Puerto Rico is a territory belonging to the US, but not actually a state incorporated into the US federation.",美國與波多黎各的關係,自1898年以來，波多黎各一直是美國的非法人領土，當時西班牙裔美國人戰爭後西班牙人。它具有一種自我政府的形式，在領土條款下受美國政府的約束。即使這不是一個主權國家，波多黎各的居民也無法投票贊成總統或在美國政府內部獲得代表。波多黎各人是天生的美國公民。實際上，波多黎各的美國公民比美國的22個州多，其公民身份與美國人其他人的公民身份相同，波多黎各人的局限性是他們居住的結果。例如，波多黎各人居住在波多黎各時，他不能投票贊成總統，但如果他搬到建立領土，他可以投票。另外，除非他在美國成立領土上生活了14年，否則波多黎各人不能成為美國的總統。但是這些要求也適用於非波多黎各美國人。根據島上的最後兩個地位全民公決，不到5％的人希望獨立，約有46％的人希望波多黎各成為一個州。其他人口希望波多黎各和美國之間存在關係，但這種關係的性質並不是很好。作為美國領土，波多黎各使用美國貨幣，美國郵政服務和波多黎各人擁有美國護照。波多黎各人不繳納聯邦稅，是美國福利的獲得者，也是社會保障和醫療保險等計劃的參與者。波多黎各人可以加入美國武裝部隊，過去被起草，波多黎各擁有活躍的美國武裝部隊基地。幾乎每個聯邦法規都適用於該島。_url_1___url_3___url_0___url_2_ //我會嘗試找到您的PDF文檔，該文件指出，波多黎各人稍後是天生的天生公民。Puertorico是屬於美國的領土，實際上並不是一個國家的國家，並不是一個國家納入美國聯合會。
Why is getting custody of children so complicated?,"Because they are priceless, living people. If a parent who isn't fit to parent gets joint or sole custody, something can happen to them. It's a very touchy situation. I got sole custody of my daughter, and it was an annoying process. The thing is that the other parent can always petition to get an order modified . So while she sits on welfare and pregnant with another man's child, I would have to take a day off from work to go out to court.

What is the origin and/or purpose of the 5 cent refund on glass bottles? Why do only some states have it?,"It is intended to create an incentive to recycle. It probably was a bigger incentive when five cents was a more meaningful percentage of the purchase price than it is today. Only some states have it because only their lawmakers saw fit to create a law to put the system to deal with it in place Michigan has a 10 cent refund on all bottles and cans to promote recycling them.

I took them back all the time as a kid to get extra money. Usually wound up with about $10-20Once upon a time soft drink manufacturers sold all soda inside of glass bottles. These glass bottles could be returned to facilities for free to be refilled or recycled. In some places you even had Glass pickup that would take your bottles back for you. Then they discovered they could put their soft drinks inside of plastic. Suddenly there was no more reason to take back the plastic and the consumers were left with no real idea of how to handle the stuff. Bottles became disposable and it lead to a massive uptick in pollution. Soft drink manufacturers started getting blames for this wasteful practice and people wanted them to shift back to glass The manufacturers responded by: 1. Lobbying congress extensively to prevent this. And 2. Creating ads to guilt people like the oh so famous crying native American advertisement. Suddenly it became about public responsibility and not about companies having to take care of the mess they made themselves. Many states adopted a soda tax to encourage people to bring back their used bottles for money, and it worked.",5美分退款在玻璃瓶上的起源和/或目的是什麼？為什麼只有一些州？,它旨在創造一種回收利用的激勵措施。當五美分比今天比現在更有意義的百分比時，這可能是一個更大的激勵措施。只有一些州之所以擁有它，是因為只有立法者認為適合製定法律，以使該系統處理該系統，以應對密歇根州的所有瓶子和罐子的退款10美分，以促進回收利用它們。人們一直在這裡帶他們去商店來賺錢。您很少在街上看到罐子或垃圾，因為人們會挑選它們。我小時候把他們帶回去，以賺取額外的錢。通常，在一份時間軟飲料製造商將所有蘇打水賣給玻璃瓶內的所有汽水製造商時，通常會花費約10-20once。這些玻璃瓶可以免費返回到設施中，以免費補充或回收。在某些地方，您甚至有玻璃拾音器，可以將瓶子帶回去。然後他們發現可以將軟飲料放入塑料中。突然，沒有更多理由取回塑料，消費者對如何處理這些東西沒有真正的想法。瓶子變成了一次性，並導致污染的大量上升。軟飲料製造商開始為這種浪費的做法而獲得責備，人們希望他們轉移回製造商的玻璃：1。遊說大會廣泛地防止這種情況。2.為像哦，如此著名的哭泣的美國原住民廣告一樣，為內gui創建廣告。突然間，這成為了公共責任，而不是因為公司必須照顧自己造成的混亂。許多州採取了蘇打稅，以鼓勵人們將二手瓶帶回貨幣上，這起作用了。
I was brought up Jewish myself. I've always wondered though: why is there a stigma about jewish people being cheap when it comes to money?,"Because in the Middle Ages lending money with an interest was a sin for Catholics, but people and governments still needed to borrow and it was ok to get it from an outsider. Before the Reform there weren't many accepted religious alternatives, Jews took the job and with it all the topics that would arise.Interesting things to explore: medieval guilds, debt in History.they dominate the diamond trade in nyc which i think where the stigma comes from, also well established in top tier banking such as goldman sachs/federal reserve",我自己成長為猶太人。但是我一直想知道：為什麼猶太人在金錢方面有廉價的污名？,因為在中世紀，借錢對天主教徒來說是一種罪過，但是人們和政府仍然需要藉錢，可以從局外人那裡得到這筆錢。在改革之前，沒有多少公認的宗教替代方案，猶太人從事這項工作，並隨之而來的所有主題。要探索的事物：中世紀公會，歷史上的債務。他們在紐約市的鑽石貿易主導污名來自，在高盛/美聯儲等頂級銀行業務中也有很好的建立
Why has the Concorde project never been brought back again?,"Largely because lie flat beds. The concorde flew twice as fast as a regular jet, but burned 10 times as much fuel. It was a single class aircraft but those ""first class"" seats were just regular economy seats with leather upholstery, and it had to be this way. Compare a 757. It contains about 190 seats, mostly economy, and is physically about the same size as a Concorde. Concorde costs 10x as much per mile to operate. It *could* have first class seats in which case it 'd carry about 45 passengers each costing the airline 40x what they 'd cost on a regular plane, or you could have 190 economy seats to minimise the per person costs as much as you can. Of course you still need to charge first class prices for these seats because of how expensive the plane is to fly. In short, Concorde never really stacked up. When it first launched, a first class passenger could choose a regularfirst class seat for 7hrs on a boeing jet, or an 'economy style' seat on Concorde for 3hrs. Even this choice wasn't attractive enough to make Concorde profitable. Once lie flat first class came onto the market, first class passengers could choose a full bed for 7 hours or an economy seat for 3. For a first class passenger, this made Concorde seem practically third world.There was a tragic accident back in 2000 or so and the industry never recovered. The company did a cost benefit analysis and decided that the extra expense wasn't worth the risk of another crash. The passengers were the richest of the rich. You can imagine the lawsuits. The internet such as Skype rendered needing to travel across the Atlantic in two hours unnecessary. It was always more of a rich man's claim to fame than a genuine method of transportation.",為什麼協和項目再也沒有帶回？,很大程度上是因為躺著平床。協和飛機的飛行速度是普通噴氣式飛機的兩倍，但燃燒的燃料燃燒了10倍。那是一架單級飛機，但是那些“頭等艙”座位只是帶有皮革內飾的常規經濟座椅，必須這樣。比較A757。它包含大約190個席位，主要是經濟，並且與協和的物理大小大致相同。協和的運營費用每英里達到10倍。它 *可以 *擁有一流的座位，在這種情況下，它載有大約45名乘客，每個乘客在普通飛機上花費40倍，或者您可以擁有190個經濟座位，以最大程度地減少每人的成本，能。當然，您仍然需要為這些座位收取一流的價格，因為飛機的飛行價格昂貴。簡而言之，協和從未真正堆積起來。首次推出時，一流的乘客可以在波音噴氣式飛機上選擇7小時的常規級別座位，或者在Concorde上為3小時的“經濟風格”座位。即使是這個選擇也不足以使協和盈利。一旦躺著的頭等艙進入市場，一流的乘客可以選擇一張完整的床7小時或經濟席大概是這個行業從未康復。該公司進行了成本收益分析，並認為額外的費用不值得再次崩潰。乘客是富人中最富有的人。您可以想像訴訟。諸如Skype之類的互聯網使需要在兩個小時內穿越大西洋的互聯網。與真正的交通方式相比，這總是一個有錢人聲名狼藉的聲明。
Why do we vote for the president if the electoral college selects the president anyways?,"I don't think you fully grasp how the EC works your vote still matters, your vote basically helps decide who the college votes for"", 'Your state votes for the party of delegates to send to the electoral college. There are a lot of misconceptions about the EC. They rarely vote for anyone other than who their state nominated them to. I believe if Virginia voted for Obama in 2012, than Virginia sends delegates from the Democratic party to cast our vote. These are lifetime party members who would not stab their own party in the back. As for its own merit, the EC is helpful in providing a weight of each state based on how populated it is. California pulls the most weight vote-wise because it has the most citizens.

"After detecting a missile launch, how does a country know if it's an attack or just a test?","Normally they tell the other country they are launching a missile. [Though sometimes they forget and there's a bit of a nuclear scare]. So far this hasn't torched off a nuclear war because most tests are just 1 rocket. And a full first strike would involve hundreds of rockets. Also the missile might not be headed in the direction of anything of value. If the choice was potentially starting a nuclear war on accident or losing an uninhabited island in the middle of the pacific that you technically own, most people pick the latter.",在發現導彈發射後，一個國家如何知道這是攻擊還是僅僅是測試？,通常，他們告訴另一個國家，他們正在發射導彈。[儘管有時他們會忘記，而且有些核恐慌]。到目前為止，這還沒有消除核戰爭，因為大多數測試只是1枚火箭。首次罷工將涉及數百枚火箭。同樣，導彈可能不會朝任何有價值的方向前進。如果選擇可能會發生意外發動核戰爭，或者在您技術上擁有的太平洋中部失去了一個無人居住的島嶼，那麼大多數人會選擇後者。
Why people suffer so much from being raped? Why isn't it just as traumatic as just getting beaten up?,"It's a combination of social stigma and trauma. When you 've been stripped of your right to choose for yourself, oftentimes forcibly, you're traumatized by the act of sexual assault, but also by the pressure of keeping quiet. Women are more likely to be raped by someone they know. Someone whom we may have mutual friends. Say you're at your best friend's party, and your rapist is her brother. He slipped something into your drink, took you upstairs and had sex with your incapacitated body. You wake up in the morning next to him, feeling filthy inside and out. What happens when you tell your friend? Your mother? Even the cops? Chances are, someone's going to say ""you asked for it."" Not to mention, people talk. Not necessarily about rape, but about sex. Women are whores when we have sex with people we haven't all but sworn our bodies to. In this analogy, your best friend's brother will look like a stud for conquering you, but you'll look like the loose slut undeserving of respect. That's why women feel traumatized. Not only do we experience the pain of sexual assault, we're told time and again by our families, friends, coworkers, deans, and even the court, that rape is our fault. We're told to be more vigilant, more prudish, and to wear more modest clothing, despite the fact that women are raped regardless of attire. So we don't talk about it. We keep that experience to ourselves because if news got out that we were sexually assaulted, there's a large possibility that we'll be met with judgments rather than support.",為什麼人們因被強姦而遭受這麼多痛苦？為什麼不像被毆打那樣創傷？,這是社會污名和創傷的結合。當您被剝奪了自己選擇的權利時，通常會強行強行，您會因性侵犯行為而受到創傷，並且由於保持安靜的壓力。婦女更有可能被認識的人強姦。我們可能有共同朋友的人。說你在最好的朋友的聚會上，你的強姦犯是她的兄弟。他把一些東西滑入您的飲料中，帶您上樓，並與無行為能力的身體發生性關係。您在他旁邊的早晨醒來，內外感到骯髒。當您告訴朋友時會發生什麼？你的母親？甚至警察？很有可能有人會說“你要它。”更不用說，人們說話。不一定是關於強姦，而是關於性的。當我們與人發生性關係時，婦女是妓女。在這個類比中，您最好的朋友的兄弟看起來像是征服您的螺柱，但是看起來像是寬鬆的蕩婦不值得尊重。這就是為什麼女性感到受傷的原因。我們不僅經歷了性侵犯的痛苦，而且我們的家人，朋友，同事，院長甚至法院一次又一次地告訴我們強姦是我們的錯。我們被告知要更加警惕，更加謹慎，並穿上更適度的衣服，儘管無論服裝如何，婦女都會被強姦。所以我們不談論它。我們會自己保持這種經驗，因為如果有消息說我們受到性侵犯，我們很有可能會得到判斷而不是支持。
Geology. How do geodes form?,"From what I understand, geodes form in pore spaces that already exist in the rock. In the case of volcanic rocks, these pores reflect the presence of dissolved gases in the lava or magma. You can learn more about how volatiles are trapped in magmas [here]. In sedimentary rocks, the pores could be the result of many processes, including expansion or dissolution after the rock has been formed. The important thing to take from this is that for geodes to form, there has to be space in a rock for them to grow. Groundwater has a lot of dissolved constituents: bicarbonate, chloride and sulfate, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and silica are among the most common. These ions become dissolved in groundwater through a wide range of processes, like interactions with the atmosphere, the surficial environment, soil, and bedrock. Groundwater flows through rocks very slowly , so the water sits in the pores in rocks. Over thousands of years, the chemicals dissolved in the groundwater precipitate out, leaving a silica gel on the interior walls of the pores in the rock. After even more time, distinct crystals begin to form. These can be many minerals, but quartz is by far the most common. Geodes can be found on the surface because quartz is very resistant to erosion. As the rock surrounding a geode is worn away, the chalcedony ""shell"" remains, leaving you with a geode. Source: I'm a geology major. But if I'm wrong on any of these points, someone please correct me!they are formed in cooling lava. Air bubbles get trapped in the rock and that air contains water vapor. This water vapor is rich in minerals and as everything cools, the minerals crystallize on the inside of the rock bubble.",地質學。土生如何形成？,據我了解，在岩石中已經存在的孔隙空間中形成了地理。在火山岩的情況下，這些孔反映了熔岩或岩漿中溶解氣體的存在。您可以進一步了解有關如何將揮發物捕獲在岩漿中[此處]的信息。在沉積岩中，孔可能是許多過程的結果，包括形成岩石後的膨脹或溶解。從中獲得的重要一點是，要形成地理，岩石中必須有空間才能生長。地下水有很多溶解的成分：碳酸氫鹽，氯化物和硫酸鹽，鈉，鈣，鎂，鉀和二氧化矽是最常見的。這些離子通過與大氣，表面環境，土壤和基岩的相互作用（例如與大氣的相互作用）溶解在地下水中。地下水流過岩石，非常緩慢地流過岩石，因此水坐在岩石中。數千年來，化學物質溶解在地下水中，在岩石中孔的內壁上留下了二氧化矽凝膠。經過更多的時間，不同的晶體開始形成。這些可能是許多礦物質，但是石英是迄今為止最常見的。由於石英對侵蝕性非常抗性，因此可以在表面上找到地理。當圍繞土工的岩石磨損時，墨西哥玉米粉的“殼”仍然留下，給您帶來了一條土地。資料來源：我是地質專業。但是，如果我的任何一個要點錯了，請有人糾正我！它們是在冷卻熔岩中形成的。氣泡被困在岩石中，空氣中含有水蒸氣。這種水蒸氣富含礦物質，隨著一切冷卻，礦物質在岩石氣泡的內部結晶。

Pulling a bad comedian off the stage using a curved cane; where does it come from?,"It's claimed that use of 'the hook' originated at Harry Miner's Bowery Theater in New York in 1903. According to a pamphlet put out by Miner later, his son Tom was the first to use the hook to pull a particularly bad amateur performer offstage. Thereafter, it became a regular feature, with crowds shouting ""get the hook"" at unpopular performancesIt comes from Vaudeville shows. Vaudeville shows often had inexperienced performers, ""variety acts"", people who would go way too long, etc. Nowadays there is a light that signals a performer that their time is up and to GTFO. But they didn't have that so they use a big shepherds crook to drag them off the stage. Cartoons, which became a thing back when vaudeville was popular, ran with this and made it it's own thing. Vaudeville was kind of like open-mic back in the day.I'm a stagehand and occasionally work music festivals. The stage manager still keeps the schedule and signals to the act when it's time to come off, we just don't use the stick any more. There's a big analogue clock that's visible on the side of stage and the SM will signal when it's last song. If the act's a bit loose and not paying attention or the crowd wants another encore we don't have time for, you'll see a man in black come on stage and have a word in their ear. Personally I'd love to bring back the hook, especially for rubbish DJS",用彎曲的拐杖將不好的喜劇演員從舞台上拉出；它從何而來？,據稱，使用“鉤子”的使用起源於1903年在紐約的哈里礦工的鮑里劇院。此後，它成為了一個常規的功能，人群在不受歡迎的表演中大喊“ Get the Hook”，來自雜耍表演。Vaudeville的表演經常沒有經驗的表演者，“綜藝節目”，那些會走得太長的人等等。如今，有一個燈光錶明表演者的時間已經到了，而GTFO的時間則是。但是他們沒有那個，所以他們使用一個大牧羊人騙子將他們拖出舞台。當沃德維爾（Vaudeville）受歡迎時，卡通（Cartoons）成為了一件事情，他跑了起來並做了自己的事。雜技演員在當天有點像開放式麥克風。舞台經理仍然會在該行為脫穎而出時將日程安排和信號保留在ACT上，我們只是不再使用棍子了。舞台側面有一個很大的模擬時鐘，在上一首歌時，SM會發出信號。如果該行為有點鬆散，沒有註意，或者人群想要我們沒有時間的另一個連續性，那麼您會看到一個黑色的男人登上舞台，並在他們的耳邊說一句話。我個人很想帶回鉤子，特別是對於垃圾DJ
How do 3.5mm minijack to cassette adapters work?,"There's a tape-head in the cassette - it fits face to face with the head in the player. When you play music through the adaptor the varying current creates a varying magnetic field in the adaptor's tape-head, which looks to the player just like the varying field it's expecting to see from having a tape dragged across it. EDIT - there should also be gears which fool the player into thinking there's a tape playing, otherwise it'll shut off or reverse, thinking it's reached the end of the tape.A more ELI5 answer: Imagine the sound from a true cassette tape is a book or better yet, a scroll. As you unroll the scroll and read what is written down, that is the same as your audio player reading data to convert into music. What the converter does is substitute the scroll for a Kindle. Instead of unrolling the scroll to read it, it simply flashes the data on one single screen for the audio player to readWhen I was a kid, I thought I could become a millionaire by taking this idea, then expanding on it to create a VHS cassette which took RCA cables. So you could plug your PlayStation into that shitty old TV at your grandparents that only had the Coaxial connection. If only 10 year old me had been just a little smarter . and invented KickStarter so I had a platform to push my idea on.You're essentially cutting out the middle man with one of those adapters. They contain a record head and butts it head to head with the read head of the tape deck, which upon encountering the faint magnetic field on the magnetic tape, turns it into an electrical signal.

"Why small bottles of soda and milk are similar, but big bottles of soda are so different than big milk containers?",Soda bottles are pressurized but milk is not. So the soda bottles have to be rounded to withstand the pressure. This means that when you stack them together there will be a lot of room between the bottles that is impossible to use. The milk containers on the other hand can be made more square so they will fit better together. The exact shape of the containers vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and from material to material. Cardboard milk cartons will often be almost perfectly square. Plastic is harder to form into a square shape on the inside so it usually have rounded corners. Glass is even harder to make square so it is usually round bottles.What do small bottles of milk and soda look like where you are from? I don't think they look like each other at all.,為什麼小瓶蘇打水和牛奶相似，但是大瓶蘇打水與大牛奶容器如此不同？,蘇打瓶被加壓，但牛奶不是。因此，必須將蘇打瓶舍入以承受壓力。這意味著，當您將它們堆疊在一起時，瓶子之間將有很多空間。另一方面，牛奶容器可以更加正方形，以便它們可以更好地合併。容器的確切形狀因製造商到製造商以及材料而異。紙板牛奶紙箱通常幾乎是完美的正方形。塑料很難在內部形成正方形，因此通常具有圓角。玻璃更難製作正方形，因此通常是圓瓶。小瓶牛奶和蘇打水看起來像您來自哪裡？我認為他們看上去根本不像。
Why we have to play nice with Pakistan.,"I'll try and keep this insanely complicated issue relatively simple but the main points are: 1) Pakistan is pretty volatile place. It doesn't have a strong tradition of democracy, tends to lurch towards military dictatorship every now and then and the government doesn't have control over large swathes of the country. What vestiges of democracy it does display are highly questionable as the Pakistani inteligence agency have huge amounts of power and their own agenda. 2) These parts of the country that the government has no control over have become a haven for extremists, some of whome are of the Al Qaeda type essentially these parts are not massively different from what Afghanistan was around 2000. 3) It's very important as a supply route to the military operation in Afghanistan. If the Pakistani's stop playing ball, it's essentially game over for the coalition. 4) The most important one: Pakistan has nuclear weapons. Basically, the US has to keep Pakistan onside because the alternative is too dangerous to think about: A failed state, riddled with extremists that could potentially access nuclear weapons. Thus, most American efforts are aimed at keeping the genie in the bottle, even if that means randomly killing Pakistani citzens from 20'000 feet via remote control. Is this the right way to go about things? Probably not. Is the alternative any better? Again, probably not. Welcome to the world of realpolitik my little 5 year old chum.",為什麼我們必須和巴基斯坦一起玩。,我將盡力使這個瘋狂複雜的問題相對簡單，但要點是：1）巴基斯坦是非常波動的地方。它沒有強大的民主傳統，傾向於時不時地偏向軍事獨裁統治，政府無法控制該國的大片。它所表現出的民主遺跡是高度質疑的，因為巴基斯坦智慧機構具有大量的權力和自己的議程。2）政府無法控制的國家的這些地區已經成為極端分子的天堂，其中一些是基地組織類型的，這些部分本質上與阿富汗大約在2000年左右沒有大不相同。3）非常重要，因為阿富汗軍事行動的供應路線。如果巴基斯坦的停止打球，那本質上是聯盟的比賽。4）最重要的一個：巴基斯坦有核武器。基本上，美國必須將巴基斯坦留在下面，因為替代方案太危險了：一個失敗的國家，充滿了可能訪問核武器的極端主義者。因此，大多數美國的努力旨在將精靈保存在瓶中，即使這意味著通過遙控器從20'000英尺處隨機殺死巴基斯坦cit。這是正確解決問題的正確方法嗎？可能不是。替代方案更好嗎？再次，可能不是。歡迎來到Realpolitik我的5歲小chum的世界。
How can you tell if a suit is high quality? Why are some suits so ridiculously expensive?,"The price of almost everything you can buy is mostly determined by two main components: material cost and man hours . If you make a suit out of cotton it will cost less than one made of silk. Since silk is so thin and lightweight, you also require more silk to get the job done. If it were possible, you could imagine that a suit made of diamonds would be even more than the silk suit. That's one part. Now the other part is just how long it takes to make. A seamstress in a sweatshop may be able to crank out a budget level cotton suit in 2 hours . If she's able to do the silk one in the exact same amount of time, the silk suit will still cost more due to the material cost, as we talked about before. However, if you're going to be making silk suits, you probably want to have a higher quality product. So rather than having a Bangladesh sweat shop make it, you would have it done by a respected seamstress in Naples. This seamstress charges more for her work and it takes her longer to make the suit, because she takes more time to make sure everything is done carefully and precisely. The cotton suit could be made in 2 hours by very cheap labor. The silk suit takes 10 hours to be made by a highly skilled laborer. You can see the silk suit is going to cost more due to it having a higher quality material and a longer manufacturing time. There are more factors at play, but this should suffice for the ELI5 explanation.",您如何判斷西裝是否高質量？為什麼一些西服如此昂貴？,您幾乎可以購買的所有物品的價格大部分是由兩個主要組成部分決定的：物料成本和男子小時。如果您用棉花製作西裝，它的價格將不到絲綢製成。由於絲綢是如此薄且輕巧，因此您還需要更多的絲綢才能完成工作。如果可能的話，您可以想像，由鑽石製成的西裝甚至比絲綢西服還要多。那是一部分。現在，另一部分是製造需要多長時間。汗衫中的裁縫可能能夠在2小時內製定預算級別的棉服。如果她能夠在完全相同的時間內完成絲綢，那麼正如我們之前談論的那樣，由於材料成本，絲綢西服仍然會花費更多。但是，如果您要製作絲綢西裝，您可能想擁有更高質量的產品。因此，與其讓孟加拉國的汗水店做到這一點，不如由那不勒斯的裁縫做到這一點。這位裁縫為她的工作提供了更多的費用，她需要更長的時間才能製作西裝，因為她花了更多時間來確保一切都仔細，精確地完成。可以通過非常便宜的勞動在2個小時內製造棉服。絲綢西服需要10個小時才能由高技能的勞動者製造。您會看到絲綢西裝的成本更高，因為它具有更高質量的材料和更長的製造時間。還有更多的因素在起作用，但這對於ELI5解釋就足夠了。

DJs and TV personalities spend a good bit of time listening to recordings of themselves and critiquing how they sound, and adapting their voices to sound less bad.I have no sources available at the moment, because I'm on my phone, but O remember reading somewhere that we hear our voice *much* differently in our heads than how it actually sounds to other people.

Why does my phone get hot as hell when playing certain games or using it as a hotspot?,"All of the parts in your phone produce heat when they're under load. The greater the load, the greater the heat generation.

Note, if the parts get TOO hot, they'll shut off. If they get too hot a lot, it's possible they could be damaged. Don't run your phone too hot for too long.Your phone is not perfectly efficient in converting energy from the battery into computations. A good percentage of the energy gets wasted as heat. The more energy the phone is using the more gets turned into heat.

"How are companies like Verizon and AT & T able to both make statements like ""The fastest internet provider"" or the ""Best internet provider"" at the same time?","Words like ""fastest"" or ""best"" don't actually mean anything. Is fastest: * Average national download speed?* Average national upload speed?* Average local * Between 8am and 5 pm?* During peak hours?* During non-peak hours?* Counting outages?* Calculated based on tiers? Is ""1st tier"" Comcast considered equivalent to ""1st tier"" Verizon?* Calculated based on the fastest tier?* The fastest tier available in that area vs what?* Etc Or is best calculated: * According to customer satisfaction? How did they get that number?* Using one of the ""fastest"" measures above?* Based off a review somewhere?* Based off availability?* Based off outages?* Based on ""value""?* Etc The word ""fastest"" and the word ""best"" can mean whatever you want them to mean. So Verizon and ATT & T can pretty much use the words any way they see fitSaying that your ISP is the ""best internet provider"" is a purely subjective claim. It's like saying that your restaurant sells the best burgers in town. There's no objective way of disputing it. This is why both Verizon and AT & T can make the same claim. Making the claim that your ISP is the ""fastest internet provider"" is a little different because this claim can be tested objectively, unlike the ""best"" claim. In this case, however, each provider is using a different criteria to make their ""fastest"" claim. This is why they both can make the same claim. Of course, it's probably not the same criteria most customers use to judge an internet service as ""fast.""",像Verizon和AT＆T這樣的公司如何同時發表“最快的互聯網提供商”或“最佳互聯網提供商”之類的陳述？,諸如“最快”或“最佳”之類的詞實際上並不意味著什麼。最快的是：*全國下載速度嗎？“第一層” comcast是否等同於“第一層” Verizon？他們是如何獲得該數字的？*使用上面的“最快”措施之一？“最佳”一詞可以意味著您想要它們的意思。因此，Verizon和ATT＆T幾乎可以使用他們看到的任何方式使用這些單詞，即您的ISP是“最佳互聯網提供商”是純粹主觀的主張。這就像說您的餐廳賣出鎮上最好的漢堡。沒有客觀的方式提出異議。這就是為什麼Verizon和AT＆T都可以提出相同的主張的原因。聲稱您的ISP是“最快的互聯網提供商”有些不同，因為與“最佳”主張不同，可以客觀地對此主張進行客觀測試。但是，在這種情況下，每個提供商都使用不同的標準來提出其“最快”主張。這就是為什麼他們倆都可以提出相同的主張。當然，大多數客戶用來判斷互聯網服務為“快速”的標準可能不是相同的標準。
How do US politicians do their jobs while they're running for president?,Mostly they don't. They may return to Washington for important votes in Congress but for the most part they just skip work while they're campaigning.,美國政客在競選總統時如何工作？,大多數情況下，他們沒有。他們可能會在國會中返回華盛頓進行重要投票，但在大多數情況下，他們只是在競選時跳過工作。
how would copyright affect fan made content using images from online?,"You can't take images you don't have a right to use, put them on something, and then sell it. This isn't a fair use situation. > the other side argues that as long as he doesn't claim ownership, and doesn't include the title, he would be fine, and that other people at conventions do the same. It's not about claiming ownership. Copyright gives you control over how things are distributed. You can't just scrub the title and sell things when everybody else would have to pay for a license. Those people at conventions are likely infringing on copyright. Everybody downloads music for free off the internet, but that doesn't make it legal to share music.

How can a sequence of bits be used to represent data in a computer system.,"There are different methods to assign code words to data. The two main ways of doing this is top down ) and bottom up , this article is probably a bit better since it has examples for both and tells you about the differences ). Imo those are the 2 ways your teacher might want to know about, they are both rather simple and i think you can find very good explanations on the internet . Try to read a bit about them and if you have specific questions just ask. I don't know your background with probabilities and information, but if you don't know the basics it might be rather hard to understand. Important concepts might be the theoretical minimal code word length, [Entropy] and [redundancy]. Edit: I forgot to mention fixed length code words, which are basically just tables where you assign each codeworth some data. It's the simplest way and you should probably mention that too. Because the other 2 ways i mentioned are a bit more complicated and produce variable length code words, which isn't always practical.By mapping certain series of bits to mean something. One common way is to map bit series to numbers in binary. You can now map those numbers to characters. Now you can represent text with bit series.To the human observer, a sequence of bits is simply a series of numbers, which unless you know how to convert binary to decimal appears to be nothing more than what we've already said: a series of binary numbers. However, our computer systems are designed to interpret these numbers in much the same way we interpret words on a page/screen and derive information from it. It all works through a complex series of rules. After applying rules to the bits that it has been given, a computer can then interpret these bits and perform some sort of response to receiving these bits; such as displaying what it's received on screen, or loading a program.",如何使用一系列序列來表示計算機系統中的數據。,有不同的方法將代碼單詞分配給數據。這樣做的兩種主要方法是自上而下的）和自下而上的，本文可能會好一些，因為它都有兩者的示例，並告訴您有關差異的信息）。IMO是您老師可能想知道的兩種方式，它們都很簡單，我認為您可以在互聯網上找到很好的解釋。嘗試閱讀一些有關它們的信息，如果您有特定的問題，請提出。我不知道您的背景有概率和信息，但是如果您不知道基本知識，那麼可能很難理解。重要的概念可能是理論最小的代碼單詞長度，[熵]和[冗餘]。編輯：我忘了提到固定的長度代碼單詞，這基本上只是您分配每個CodeWorth一些數據的表。這是最簡單的方法，您可能也應該提到這一點。因為我提到的其他兩種方法更複雜，並且會產生可變的長度代碼單詞，這並不總是實用的。通過將某些系列的位映射到含義的意思。一種常見的方法是將BIT系列映射到二進制中的數字。您現在可以將這些數字映射到字符。現在您可以用位序列表示文字。對於人類觀察者，一系列的序列只是一系列數字，除非您知道如何將二進制轉換為十進制，否則似乎無非是我們已經說過的話：二進制數。但是，我們的計算機系統旨在以我們在頁面/屏幕上解釋單詞的方式來解釋這些數字，並從中獲取信息。這一切都通過一系列複雜的規則來起作用。在將規則應用於已給出的位後，計算機可以解釋這些位並對接收這些位執行某種響應；例如顯示在屏幕上收到的內容或加載程序。

How do normal 3D glasses differ from IMAX 3D glasses and such?,"3d glasses are meant to make your eyes see slightly different images so you have a sense of depth. The colored ones do this by having the two different images slightly tinted, and then the colored glasses filter out one from each side. The red eye doesn't see the blue image and vice versa. The imax ones make use of something called polarization, which is something many sunglasses have. Essentially it makes it so that only light that is oriented a particular direction can make it through the glasses. The left eye takes the up and down light, and the right eye the side to side light. This allows you to see two separate images without screwing the color",普通的3D眼鏡與IMAX 3D眼鏡等有何不同？,3D眼鏡的目的是使您的眼睛看到略有不同的圖像，因此您有深度感。彩色的玻璃杯通過將兩個不同的圖像稍微著色，然後從每一側過濾出一個，來做到這一點。紅眼看不到藍色圖像，反之亦然。IMAX的人利用了所謂的極化，這是許多太陽鏡所擁有的。從本質上講，它使它成為一種使特定方向的光能通過眼鏡使其能夠使其能夠使其通過眼鏡。左眼上下光線，右眼向側面光到側燈。這使您可以看到兩個單獨的圖像而不會擰緊顏色

Why do people use LiveLeak instead of Youtube?,"Liveleak doesn't have the same rules about violence.

I had/have an account there username Gretzkys_Jetskis and had some mild success there. When you upload a video, LiveLeak mods decide whether your video will be ""featured"" or not. It's not based entirely on view or voting. - when I used live leak I would check it every day for their new features videos. In that way; LiveLeak operates more like ebaums/buzzfeed. Compare that with youtube. It's completely different. I can go on YouTube and spend hours watching muppet babies videos which will eventually lead me to dark wing duck videos, then videos about duck, turducken, gravy, thanksgiving videos, etc. - live leak is self contained but it serves a purpose. If you can't find a video of recent events that youtube won't host, you can almost always find it on liveleak. So really. It's a back up for YouTube, an excellent source for video mirrors. The only downside to liveleak is that their search function is pretty much useless. Also; if you really want real gore - go to _URL_0_ - I wouldn't suggest I though.

Why are human taste buds so varied? Why do some people really like one thing while others really don't?,"It is NOT just upbringing. People taste things differently due to genetics.

To some people, it has an odious, soapy, floral flavor that ruins everything it's in. Others find it delicious. These responses can be found in people who have never tasted or heard of these things before. There is considerable genetic variation in what food tastes like to different people as well as how strongly the food tastes. Supertasters have more taste buds than most people do, and so detect flavors more strongly.",為什麼人類的味蕾如此多樣？為什麼有些人真的很喜歡一件事，而另一些人真的不喜歡？,這不僅是成長經歷。由於遺傳學，人們的品嚐不同。有一種稱為苯基菌的化學物質 - 人們要么品嚐它，要么沒有品嚐。就個人而言，我是品嚐者。同樣，香菜具有相似的效果。對於某些人來說，它具有令人討厭的肥皂和花香，破壞了它所處的一切。其他人則發現它很美味。這些回應可以在從未品嚐過或從未聽說過這些東西的人中找到。食物對不同人的口味以及食物的味道有多種遺傳差異。超級植物的味蕾比大多數人都多，因此更強烈地發現風味。

"Why do words like calculator, accelerator and detonator end in or instead of er?","*-or* is a Latin suffix used to indicate a ""noun agent,"" i.e., a noun that is *doing something*, often acting as the subject of a sentence. *-er*, on the other hand, is a *Germanic* suffix that serves the same function as *-or* does in Latin. So. When the root word is taken from the Latin, one expects to find its noun agent form ending in *-or*, whereas when the root is Germanic, one expects to find *-er*. Doesn't always happen that way though. Why? Because *English*. It's a messIt has to do with the etymology of the word in most cases. Words with Latin origin typically end in -or, while Germanic words have the -er suffix",為什麼像計算器，加速器和雷管這樣的單詞以或代替ER結束？,*-or*是用於指示“名詞代理”的拉丁語後綴，即*在做*做某事*的名詞，通常充當句子的主題。另一方面，*-er*是*日耳曼*的後綴，其功能與*-or*在拉丁語中具有相同的功能。所以。當從拉丁語中獲取詞根時，人們希望找到其名詞代理形式以 *-or *結尾，而當根部是日耳曼語時，人們希望找到 *-er *。並非總是這樣發生。為什麼？因為 *英語 *。在大多數情況下，這與該詞的詞源有關。拉丁語起源的單詞通常以-or結尾，而日耳曼語的單詞具有-er後綴
What is a Conflict of Interest in business? Can you give me an example of a famous one?,"A conflict of interest is when one relationship obligates you to do one thing but another obligates you to do something else. In Mad Men, they're an advertising firm, right? If they had two clients who were airlines, running an advertising campaign for one of them would implicitly be harming their other client since the two airlines are competing for the same market share. Maybe a more visceral example is the conspiracy theory that a cure for cancer exists, but pharmaceutical companies don't produce it because it's more profitable to treat cancer over a person's lifetime instead of curing them of it once and for all. The conflict of interest there would be between their customers, whom they are obligated to treat, and their stockholders, to whom they are obligated to make the most money.",什麼是商業利益衝突？你能給我一個著名的例子嗎？,利益衝突是，當一種關係使您做一件事，而另一個關係有義務使您做其他事情。在瘋子中，他們是一家廣告公司，對嗎？如果他們有兩個是航空公司的客戶，則為其中一個客戶開展廣告活動將隱含損害他們的另一個客戶，因為這兩家航空公司正在爭奪相同的市場份額。也許一個更為內在的例子是陰謀理論，即存在治愈癌症的方法，但是製藥公司不會生產它，因為它可以在一個人的一生中治療癌症，而不是一勞永逸地治療癌症。他們的客戶之間的利益衝突將會存在，他們有義務對待他們和他們的股東，他們有義務賺錢。

Why the Fed would raise rates right now?,"Low interest rates are not meant to be permanent. If they are used permanently, they lose their effectiveness when used as an emergency measure. Economists do not believe that low interest rates produce anything more than temporary gains, so by raising it we restore our emergency capacity. By raising interest rates, the government also slows inflation, which is an important consideration when it can be afforded.Low interest rates are only beneficial in the short run. In the medium and long run, they become ineffective. Furthermore, low interest rates grow an economy artificially which is in fact a bubble which you would rather steadily deflate with increasing the interest rate rather than having it burst.",美聯儲為什麼現在會提高利率？,低利率並不意味著永久性。如果將它們永久使用，則將其用作緊急措施時會失去效力。經濟學家認為，低利率除了臨時收益之外，還不會產生更多的收益，因此，通過提高我們恢復了緊急情況。通過提高利率，政府也減慢了通貨膨脹，這是一個重要的考慮因素。低利率僅在短期內有益。在中長期中，它們變得無效。此外，低利率人為地增長了一個經濟，實際上是一個泡沫，您寧願隨著增加利率而穩定地放氣而不是使其破裂。
How Inbreeding screws up the genetic code.,"Your genetic material is organized into pairs of chromosomes. The two chromosomes in a pair are not the same. You have one from your mother and one from your father. Now, scattered around in your chromosomes are some damaged genes that don't work properly. Mostly this is fine because for every damaged gene on a chromosome, it's very likely that there is a good gene on the other chromosome that will do the job, so it's usually not a problem unless both genes are damaged. Since most people don't have very many damaged genes, if you just pick two people at random it's very likely that whatever damaged genes one of them has, they will be fine in the other. So no problem. However, damaged genes are still passed on to your children. Say you have a daughter Y. Half of her chromosomes come from you. Now you make another kid with your daughter . X now has half his chromosomes from you, and the other half from his mother, who is Y, but she has half of *her* chromosomes from you, so about half of X's chromosomes from Y are actually yours, too. All of a sudden it becomes much more likely that X has at least one pair of identical chromosomes. And that's bad, because it means that damaged genes on one of the chromosomes are also damaged on the other. So inbreeding actually increases the probability that *problems that are already there* will become apparent. If you don't have any damaged genes, inbreeding is fine. So when you isolate a bunch of people and they have to start inbreeding , there will be problems for a while until evolution can clean up the genetic pool. Basically large populations can support more bad genes, and the human population is quite large indeed.",近親繁殖如何擰緊遺傳密碼。,您的遺傳物質被組織成成對的染色體。一對中的兩個染色體不同。你有一個來自母親的人，父親有一個。現在，散佈在您的染色體中的是一些受損的基因，這些基因無法正常工作。通常，這很好，因為對於染色體上的每個受損基因，其他染色體上都有一個好基因可以完成這項工作，因此除非兩個基因都受損，否則通常不是問題。由於大多數人沒有太多受損的基因，因此，如果您只是隨機選擇兩個人，那麼其中一個損壞的基因很可能會有任何損壞的基因，它們在另一個人中都會很好。所以沒問題。但是，受損的基因仍傳遞給您的孩子。假設您有一個女兒Y。她的一半染色體來自您。現在，您和女兒一起生另一個孩子。X現在有一半的染色體，而他的母親的另一半是Y，但她的染色體有一半的 * *她的 * * *染色體，因此Y的X染色體中約有一半也是您的。突然之間，X具有至少一對相同的染色體的可能性更大。這很糟糕，因為這意味著其中一個染色體上受損的基因也受到了損害。因此，近親繁殖實際上增加了已經存在 *已經存在的問題的概率。如果您沒有任何損壞的基因，那麼近交就可以了。因此，當您隔離一群人並且必須開始近交時，會有一段時間的問題，直到進化可以清理遺傳池為止。基本上，人口可以支持更多的壞基因，而且人口確實很大。

How are T-mobile's unlimited data categories hurting Net Neutrality?,"It's good for consumers in the short term. What's bad about it is that it hurts the next startup streaming service. Suppose that tomorrow some new company comes out that offers something in-between Netflix and Hulu - maybe it's a bit more expensive, like $25/month, but it includes all major TV shows and movies rather than a limited selection, and with no commercials. Sounds awesome, right? Here's the problem: even though people might love that new streaming service in theory, if they end up eating through all of their bandwidth they may just go back to Netflix, because that one doesn't count towards their data cap. The only way this new competitor can get exempted from the data cap is to get the attention of the major carriers and negotiate some sort of payment - but while they're still a startup, they're not big enough for anyone to care about, and they don't have the budget for that. So in effect, it makes it unfair for future competition. Not everyone agrees with this, but most net neutrality purists feel that carriers shouldn't be allowed to give preference to any data at all, even if they're not actually slowing down anything else. They feel this is important to have a level playing field, otherwise the carriers are essentially picking and choosing which Internet companies get an unfair advantage over others.",T-Mobile的無限數據類別如何傷害網絡中立性？,在短期內對消費者有好處。不好的是它傷害了下一個啟動流媒體服務。假設明天有一些新公司出來，它提供了Netflix和Hulu之間的一些東西 - 也許價格昂貴，例如每月25美元，但它包括所有主要的電視節目和電影，而不是有限的選擇，並且沒有廣告。聽起來很棒，對吧？問題是：即使人們可能喜歡從理論上喜歡的新流服務，但如果他們最終通過所有帶寬進食，他們可能會返回Netflix，因為那個人並不依賴於他們的數據上限。這位新競爭對手可以免於數據上限的唯一方法是吸引主要承運人的注意並進行某種付款，但雖然他們仍然是一家初創公司，但他們不夠大，任何人都不足以關心，關心，他們沒有預算。因此，實際上，這使得未來的競爭不公平。並非每個人都同意這一點，但是大多數網絡中立性純粹主義者都認為，即使他們實際上並沒有減慢其他任何數據，也不應允許承運人偏愛任何數據。他們認為擁有一個公平的競爭環境很重要，否則運營商實際上是選擇哪些互聯網公司比其他公司獲得不公平的優勢。

How do smartphones have the whole screen light up?,"The screen is composed of multiple layers. The top layer is the glass. Below that is the pixel array that creates the colors you see on screen.

That's what makes it look like there's just one solid light behind the screen when in fact it's usually an array of many lights.Depending on what type of display you have, it uses either a backlight or individual LEDs ",智能手機如何打開整個屏幕？,屏幕由多層組成。頂層是玻璃。在下面是像素數組，它會在屏幕上創建您看到的顏色。在下面就是所謂的瀰漫層，通常是一塊半透明的塑料，質地類似於磨砂玻璃。後面是一個燈，稱為背光。背光閃耀在瀰漫層上，這將光擴散在整個表面上。這就是使屏幕後面只有一個固體照明的原因，而實際上它通常是許多燈光。

"On 9/11, Why weren't the 2 planes headed for the twin towers shot down for being in restricted airspace? Or not shot down at all?","Keep in mind that much of the security on aircraft is a result of 9/11. It would be common for passengers to get to go and look around the cockpit during a flight; there were no heavy locking doors. Security was significantly more relaxed, so bringing small weapons less difficult than with the modern TSA . On top of that you have the precedent set by previous hijackings where the hijackers wanted the plane as a means of transportation or wanted the passengers as hostages. 9/11 was so jarring to the world because the hijackers wanted the planes themselves to be used as weapons. On 9/11 the U.S. was at peace. We didn't have armed planes sitting all over the place to quickly intercept any plane that gets out of line. However, when the reality of 9/11 became clear we *did* scramble fighters. [This] article is about an F-16 pilot who was ordered into the air to intercept Flight 93 which was ultimately downed in Pennsylvania. The aircraft had no weapons loaded on board; it was a suicide mission to physically strike the Boeing 757 with her plane to knock it out of the sky. The article is a good read. It sheds some light onto the pre-9/11 atmosphere in the United States.",在9/11，為什麼沒有駛向限制空域而擊落的兩架雙塔呢？還是根本沒有被擊落？,請記住，飛機上的大部分安全性是9/11的結果。乘客在飛行過程中去環顧座艙很常見。沒有重鎖門。安全性的放鬆程度要大得多，因此，與現代TSA相比，小型武器的難度較小。最重要的是，您擁有以前的劫機者設定的先例，劫機者希望飛機作為運輸方式，或者希望乘客作為人質。9/11對世界感到如此震驚，因為劫機者希望飛機本身被用作武器。9/11美國處於和平。我們沒有武裝的飛機坐在整個地方，以迅速攔截任何失去線路的飛機。但是，當9/11的現實變得清晰時，我們 *確實 *爭奪戰鬥機。[這篇文章]是關於一名F-16飛行員，該飛行員被命令攔截93號航班，該航班最終在賓夕法尼亞州被擊落。飛機上沒有裝有武器。這是一個自殺任務，是用飛機將波音757物理撞到天空中。這篇文章是一本很好的閱讀。它在美國的9/11前氛圍上散發了一些燈光。
"What the numbers mean on county roads and interstates (I.E. Route 70, I-95, etc.)","For federal highways and interstates, they're numbered according to which direction they run in and where they're located. East-west highways are even-numbered and north-south highways are odd numbered. For interstates, the lower numbers are in the west and south, and increase as you move north or east . This system is reversed for federal highways: lower numbers are found in the north and east and increase as you move south or west . Three-digit highway numbers indicate a spur or loop off of a highway. In Washington DC, which Interstate 95 passes through, you'll also find the loop I-495 and the spur I-395 . This same principle holds true for federal highways: a spur off of US-1 might be numbered US-301, while a loop around it might be numbered US-401. Finally, numbers for spurs and loops may be re-used in other states: there is another spur numbered I-395 in Maryland, which is not in any related to the highway in Washington DC. I don't know how state and county routes are numbered; in my state, they seem to be pretty random.",數字在縣道和州際公路上的含義（即70號公路，I-95等）,對於聯邦高速公路和州際公路，它們的編號是按照他們沿著哪個方向和位置的位置進行編號。東西方高速公路均勻，南北高速公路奇數。對於州際，較低的數字在西方和南部，並且隨著向北或向東移動時增加。該系統在聯邦高速公路上顛倒了：在北部和東部發現了較低的數量，並隨著向南或向西移動時增加。三位數的高速公路號表示高速公路上的刺或循環。在95號州際公路通過的華盛頓特區，您還會找到循環I-495和SPUR I-395。聯邦高速公路的同樣原則也是如此：US-1的啟動可能為US-301，而周圍的循環可能是US-401編號。最後，在其他州可能會重複使用馬刺和循環的數字：馬里蘭州還有另一項刺激的I-395，這與華盛頓特區的高速公路無關。我不知道州和縣的路線是如何編號的；在我的狀態下，它們似乎是非常隨機的。
Why are log cabins so much colder than traditional houses even when both are heated?,"Traditional houses have fiberglass insulation, which insulates the house by trapping a warm layer of air. Since log cabins only have a wooden wall separating the interior of the cabin from the outside environment, they aren't as good at keeping the heat in.",為什麼木艙即使兩者都被加熱也比傳統房屋要冷得多？,傳統房屋具有玻璃纖維隔熱材料，可以通過捕獲溫暖的空氣來絕緣房屋。由於小木屋只有木牆將機艙內部與外部環境區分開，因此它們不太擅長保持熱量。
Why do the nails on my fingers grow faster than the nails on my toes?,"Scientists don't have a solid explanation for this, but based on observations of fingernail growth trends over time, such as nails on longer fingers averaging faster fingernail growth , dominant hands averaging faster fingernail growth rate, and fingernail growth rate increasing over the last few decades, they've come up with some theories. Looks like the two main theories are that the amount of use a finger/toe gets affects nail growth rate, which would also explain why longer fingers and dominant hands have faster-growing nails, or that fingernails grow faster than toenails because of higher blood flow, since your fingers are closer to your heart than your toes. This is a summary of a few google results I found, so probably oversimplified and missing some stuff.Because toes have less blood flow, they can only grow so fast. Essentially our toe nails are fed less, meaning they grow slower. People with bad blood pressure have slower growing nails than people with healthy blood pressure.Blood flow. Typing is actually obscenely good for this - as you strike the keys it increases the bloodflow to your fingertips in pulses. This in turn nourishes the nail bed and allows the nails to grow faster. As our fingers are our making poking, caressing, fingering and grabbing devices, they are almost constantly in motion, and the majority of that motion in a digital age involves the tips . This means they have increased flow, and again, nourishes the nail bed and allows the nails to grow faster. With your feet, most of the impact is not on the tips, but on the sole, so there's not the same amount of direct feed to your nail beds.",為什麼我的手指上的指甲長於我的腳趾上的指甲？,科學家對此沒有可靠的解釋，但是基於對指甲生長趨勢的觀察，例如指甲上的指甲平均更快的指甲生長，主動指甲的主導速度平均更快的指甲生長速度，而指甲的增長速度則增加了。幾十年來，他們提出了一些理論。看來這兩個主要理論是，手指/腳趾的使用量會影響指甲的生長速率，這也可以解釋為什麼更長的手指和占主導地位的手具有更快的指甲，或者指甲由於血流較高而比腳趾甲更快。，由於您的手指比腳趾更靠近您的心臟。這是我發現的一些Google結果的摘要，因此可能過度簡化和缺少一些東西。由於腳趾的血流較少，因此它們只能生長得如此之快。從本質上講，我們的腳趾指甲的餵食較少，這意味著它們越來越慢。血壓不良的人的指甲生長較慢，而血壓健康。實際上，打字是淫穢的 - 當您敲打鑰匙時，它會增加血流，以脈衝的指尖。這反過來滋養了指甲床，並使指甲長得更快。當我們的手指是我們進行戳戳，愛撫，指法和抓取設備時，它們幾乎不斷地運動，並且數字時代的大部分運動都涉及技巧。這意味著它們的流量增加，然後再次滋養指甲床，並使指甲長得更快。有了您的腳，大多數影響不是對尖端，而是鞋底，因此直接飼料的直接飼料與指甲床沒有相同數量。
Is there a meaning to EXTREMELY vivid dreams?,"Dreams are basically your subconscious processing recent events, and sometimes non-recent events that were possibly triggered somehow. Regardless of how vivid, that's all dreams are. Now, having your subconscious have free-reign especially when your amygdala is turned off, might give you some insight into your life at the moment. There is absolutely *nothing* supernatural about it; it's just your thoughts given free reign and there's *absolutely no guaranty* that your brain isn't just throwing random things at you. That said, if you wake up with enough memories of your dreams, a dream journal might be a useful thing. Write down everything you remember as soon as you wake up. Then read through it, and see if you can see patterns that apply to real life. You seem to already identify that there's always conflict, so perhaps this is something you need to look into in real life and deal with. Or, again, it could be random. As to being rested - if you're having dreams it means you're in REM sleep which is *essential* for being rested.

"how skin can be ""dry"" or ""moisturized"", and why pouring water on it doesn't help.","Your skin has glands that produce oil, just like it has glands that produce sweat. This oil, called sebum, is what ""moisturizes"" your skin. What it actually does is prevent water from inside you body from evaporating out quickly, while also lubricating the skin to prevent cracking and tearing. Skin lotions/moisturizers all mimic this natural effect. Just pouring water on wouldn't help , because the protective coating is an oil. Drinking water and staying hydrated in other ways can help replenish the water your body is constantly losing. Water loss through the skin is actually somewhat small though. Cracking and tearing of skin is basically what chapped lips actually are. Not only is the skin on our lips some of the thinnest on our body, but it also lacks the glands that produce sebum. The lips do get some protection from the glands in the surrounding skin, but not a lot. The thin skin combined with a weak protective coating causes the lips to dry out more frequently. In cold air , the lips dry out faster than our body can compensate, thus giving you chapped lips. This is why people use chapstick, which is basically just wax, it mimics the effect of the body's natural oils by trapping moisture. Any fat would work though. The Inuit -- who know a thing or two about cold weather -- traditionally smeared their lips with whale or seal blubber. FUN FACT: As skin dries out, it flakes. This is what causes Black people to appear ""ashy."" White people get ashy too, but, since they're already white, it's less noticeable.",皮膚如何被“乾燥”或“保濕”，以及為什麼在上面倒水無濟於事。,您的皮膚具有產生油的腺體，就像它具有產生汗水的腺體一樣。這種稱為皮脂的油是“滋潤”皮膚的原因。實際上，它實際上是防止體內的水快速蒸發出來，同時還可以潤滑皮膚以防止開裂和撕裂。皮膚乳液/保濕劑都模仿了這種自然效果。僅倒水就無濟於事，因為防護塗層是油。飲用水和以其他方式保持水分可以幫助補充身體不斷損失的水。不過，通過皮膚的水分流失實際上有些小。皮膚的破裂和撕裂基本上是嘴唇的實際含量。我們嘴唇上的皮膚不僅是我們體內最薄的，而且還缺乏產生皮脂的腺體。嘴唇確實可以免受周圍皮膚中的腺體的保護，但沒有很多。薄的皮膚和弱保護塗層會導致嘴唇更頻繁地干燥。在冷空氣中，嘴唇的干燥速度比我們身體可以補償的快，從而使您裂開了嘴唇。這就是為什麼人們使用Chapstick（基本上只是蠟），它通過捕獲水分來模仿人體天然油的影響。任何脂肪都可以起作用。因紐特人 - 關於寒冷天氣的一兩件事 - 傳統上用鯨魚或密封味塗抹了嘴唇。有趣的事實：隨著皮膚乾燥，它會剝落。這就是導致黑人顯得“灰燼”的原因。白人也變得灰燼，但是，由於它們已經是白人，所以它不太明顯。
"How is tesla doing so well while losing $4,000 per car? Is that loss misleading?","They aren't losing $4,000 per car.

Why is almost all car accident footage from Russia?,"There's a lot of issues with car insurance claims in Russia in terms of who's at fault in the claim, and a lot of people have claimed that even the police are complicit in wrongful claims in reports as well. Consequently a huge proportion of the driving population use dashcams so their side of the argument will hold up in court or in the eyes of insurers, so they capture a large amount of the car stuff that goes viral.Russia is super corrupt but has decent infrastructure and the rule of law.

Why does there appear to be more human mutations in some African and Asian countries?,"This is because of a lack of migration. Apart from the Bantu who spread from West Africa, the other groups did not migrate. Hence, in places such as the Sahel, Ethiopia , and South-West Africa, there is a lot of genetic difference as these areas were not conquered by the Bantu tribes. Simiarly, the same applies to places in Asia such as Papua New Guinea. Another factor is that the ADHD gene is suspected to have evolved in Northern Africa, pushing the people there towards more greener pastures. I don't remember where I read it, but I do recall reading that the ADHD gene is much less common in sub-saharan Africans. Because of a lack of spread in the gene pool, this led to the tribes being unable to acquire resistance towards physical deformities and such.",為什麼一些非洲和亞洲國家似乎似乎有更多的人類突變？,這是因為缺乏遷移。除了從西非蔓延的班圖人外，其他團體也沒有遷移。因此，在諸如薩赫勒，埃塞俄比亞和西南非洲之類的地方，由於這些地區沒有被班圖部落征服，因此存在很大的遺傳差異。同樣，這也適用於亞洲（如巴布亞新幾內亞）的地方。另一個因素是，懷疑ADHD基因已在北非進化，將那裡的人們推向了更綠色的牧場。我不記得在哪裡閱讀它，但我確實記得讀到，在撒哈拉以南非洲人中，多動症基因不那麼普遍。由於基因庫缺乏傳播，這導致部落無法獲得對身體畸形等的抵抗。

Why don't we add salt directly into asphalt?,"It would wash away from the rain since salt is water soluble. Great idea though. They have gone from spreading crystals around to spraying brine on the roads where I live which gives a more even distribution / coating to roads and uses less salt for better coverage.If it's not on the surface, it would not have an effect. If it was on the surface it would be easily dislodged, and would likely be in too low a concentration to have a significant benefit. If it was in a high enough concentration to have a significant benefit, your road is made of shitty salt and is going to wear away pretty easily.Because salt and other ice melting chemicals work by dissolving into the ice and lowering its freezing point. So the first time it rains or snows, all the salt in the asphalt would dissolve and the road surface would be like swiss cheese.Actually, this is being tested on a biking lane in the Netherlands. It *does* work and the asphalt stays clean until about 6 C below zero.

"Why did the tribes of say, Africa, develop less technology then the people of Europe?","This concept is well explored in a book called Guns, Germs, and Steel. I would urge you to read/watch it if you ever find time. It should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does posit a number of very good theories. Essentially what it boils down to , is food supply. The agricultural revolution in Europe led to more efficient farming methods that required less work for more food. Less work equals more time, more time leads to boredom, boredom leads to curiosity, et cetera. So while everyone else around the world was spending all their daylight hours farming, Europe was spending a few daylight hours farming and the rest tinkering with stuff. This, theoretically, jump-started the scientific progress of the Europeans, and led to their eventual domination of the globe. To play Devil's advocate, however, there were a number of other highly successful and powerful empires and civilizations throughout history, some of which we know quite a bit about , and some of which we don't . Many of these empires developed, for their time, very advanced technology, but all of these empires inevitably collapsed and much of that technology was then lost. Only very recently has Europe held such dominance in technology. It should also be noted that Europe rose to power in the form of Rome and Macedonia, but also collapsed into the Dark Ages before re-rising to power in the modern context. A great deal of Europe's post-Dark Ages society is based on science and math kept alive by the Arabs , and wouldn't have been possible without the Crusades bringing a lot of that information back. So I guess the simplest explanation is probably pure luck. Of all the incredibly powerful civilizations that rose up and fell throughout history, Europe managed to do so right on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution and rise of globalization, ensuring their global dominance in the modern age. One might argue, however, that the balance of technological power is slowly shifting back towards the east, as China and India are definitely making up for lost time in the technological race against America and Europe.",為什麼說非洲的部落要比歐洲人民更少發展技術？,在一本名為Guns，Germs和Steel的書中對這個概念進行了很好的探索。如果您有時間，我敦促您閱讀/觀看。它應該用一粒鹽來服用，但確實提出了許多非常好的理論。從本質上講，它歸結為食物供應。歐洲的農業革命導致了更有效的農業方法，這些方法需要更少的工作才能獲得更多食物。更少的工作等於更多的時間，更多的時間導致無聊，無聊導致好奇心，等等。因此，儘管世界各地的其他所有人都花了所有的日光耕作，但歐洲正在花幾天的時間耕種，其餘的東西都在修補東西。從理論上講，這跳動了歐洲人的科學進步，並導致了他們最終對地球的統治。然而，為了扮演魔鬼的擁護者，在整個歷史上，還有許多其他非常成功，有力的帝國和文明，其中一些我們對此有很多了解，而其中一些我們沒有。這些帝國中的許多人都在他們的時代發展了非常先進的技術，但是所有這些帝國都不可避免地崩潰了，然後丟失了許多技術。直到最近，歐洲才在技術領域擁有如此優勢。還應該指出的是，歐洲以羅馬和馬其頓的形式上台，但在現代背景下重新升起之前，也崩潰了黑暗時代。大量歐洲的後漆時代社會基於阿拉伯人的科學和數學，而沒有十字軍東征將很多信息帶回來，就不可能實現。因此，我想最簡單的解釋可能是純粹的運氣。在整個歷史上都浮出水面的所有強大的文明中，歐洲設法在工業革命和全球化的興起上做到了這一點，從而確保了它們在現代的全球統治地位。但是，人們可能會認為，技術力量的平衡正在慢慢地向東轉移，因為中國和印度肯定在與美國和歐洲的技術競賽中彌補了浪費的時間。
LI5 Why people are so down on Obama now?,"First off, I think it's worth saying openly that the ""approval"" marks that you're seeing for Obama are pretty universal of politicians. Many politicians, either out of real desire or interest in gaining votes, will make promises that they later do not keep. This can be because they didn't realize how hard it is to effect change, or because they had no intention of keeping them anyway. * Guantanamo - Obama stated when he was running that he would close Gitmo and grant *habeas corpus* to its inmates. Gitmo is still open and though some inmates have received trials or hearings, many have been at military tribunal without good counsel. * Taxes - Obama stated that he would shift the tax burden more to the wealthy and corporations, and give tax breaks to the middle class. The Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy are still active though, and the middle class has not received significant tax breaks. * Business - Obama stated he would push for more accountability on the part of Wall Street, including prohibiting executive bonuses for companies that received government aid. This never happened, and most of the companies that received a bailout paid their top executives multi-million dollar bonuses. There are many things he has made good on, such as a healthcare bill and getting out of Iraq, but people in general will find reasons to dislike him. In addition, the fact remains that through naivete or political gaming, he made promises that have been brokenA quick answer would be: Republicans believe that he is promoting things like universal healthcare which are not in line with their views, and the Democrats who initially supported him believe that he is compromising too much with Republicans on certain issues and being too centrist. Hopefully others will have more details to add.",li5為什麼人們現在對奧巴馬如此沮喪？,首先，我認為值得一提的是，您對奧巴馬看到的“批准”標誌是政客的普遍性。許多政客，無論是出於真正的願望還是對獲得選票的興趣，都會向以後不保留的承諾。這可能是因為他們沒有意識到影響變化有多困難，或者因為他們無意保留它們。*關塔那摩 - 奧巴馬說，他何時跑步，他將把gitmo和Grant * Hapeas corpus *與囚犯聯繫起來。Gitmo仍然開放，儘管有些囚犯接受了審判或聽證會，但許多囚犯在沒有好的律師的情況下就在軍事法庭上。*稅收 - 奧巴馬說，他將把稅收負擔更加轉移給富人和公司，並給中產階級稅收減免。富人的布什時代減稅措施仍然很活躍，中產階級尚未獲得大量稅收減免。*業務 - 奧巴馬錶示，他將在華爾街的一方提出更多責任，包括禁止為獲得政府援助的公司的執行獎金。這從未發生過，大多數獲得救助的公司都支付了他們最高高管的數百萬美元獎金。他做了很多事情，例如醫療法案和離開伊拉克，但總的來說，人們會發現不喜歡他的理由。此外，事實仍然是，通過野蠻或政治遊戲，他做出了很快答案的諾言：共和黨人認為，他正在推廣諸如普遍醫療保健之類的事物，這些醫療保健與他們的觀點不符，而最初支持的民主黨人他認為，在某些問題上，共和黨人對共和黨人的妥協和過於中間派妥協。希望其他人將有更多細節要添加。
how to effectively analyze news articles and sources for potential bias.,"First you need to acknowledge every source has bias, you can't eliminate it completely. The basic things to do are Read through the article. Cut out every adjective and adverb and every subjective word or sentence. Pay attention to attribution and expressions of doubt! Bill Cosby didn't sexually assault, he *allegedly* assaulted. You'll often find phrases like 'according to a X'. The reason media with decent places do this is because 'pie is the best' is subjective, but 'Paul says pie is the best' is a fact. Be aware of conflicts of interest. Nobody believes what the tobacco company says about the health related effects of tobacco. Be aware of pretend experts. If their credentials aren't listed, be wary of them. If their credentials are 'wrote a book' be doubly wary of them. There are many more, but these are good starting points.",如何有效分析新聞文章和潛在偏見的來源。,首先，您需要確認每個來源都有偏見，您不能完全消除它。要做的基本事情是通過文章閱讀的。刪除每個形容詞和副詞以及每個主觀單詞或句子。請注意歸因和疑問的表達！比爾·科斯比（Bill Cosby）沒有性侵犯，據稱他 *襲擊了。您通常會發現諸如“根據x”之類的短語。具有不錯的地方的媒體之所以這樣做是因為“派是最好的”是主觀的，但是“保羅說派是最好的”是事實。注意利益衝突。沒有人相信煙草公司對煙草與健康相關的影響的看法。請注意假裝專家。如果未列出他們的憑據，請謹慎對待。如果他們的資格是“寫書”，請雙重警惕。還有更多，但是這些都是很好的起點。

"If embarrassment and laughter are considered advanced emotions, as human brains develop will we pick up other emotions?","There is no reason to expect we won't. There is no reason to expect we will. Our evolutionary pressures are completely unprecedented. We have no effective predators, and enough capability to eliminate any earth created predator before it becomes effective. That leaves ourselves as our only evolutionary pressure. The last time this happened there was only 1 species on the planet. It is possible that we lose emotions.

What makes your poo bright green when you're NOT sick?,"Either you have eaten something with strong green color, either artificial or natural OR you are having very short intestinal transit time - i.e. stuff passes very quickly from your stomach to your colon and out as poo. Gallblader secretions are green as they leave the gallbladder. During the passage through the intestine the color normally changes gradually to the yellow-brownish hue of regular feces. With a very quick passage though there isn't enough time for this process to take place and the poo can come out still green. Feces without gallbladder secretions all together is almost colorless. The stuff that makes the gall fluid green and then turns yellow and brown are degradation products of hemoglobin, the stuff that makes the red blood cells red.",當您沒有生病時，是什麼使您的大便明亮的綠色？,您要么吃了綠色強的東西，要么是人造的，要么是腸道過境時間很短，即東西從胃中迅速傳遞到結腸，然後作為便便。膽囊分泌物是綠色的，因為它們離開了膽囊。在通過腸道的過程中，顏色通常會逐漸變成常規糞便的黃色色調。儘管沒有足夠的時間進行此過程，但通便時間仍然很快，而且便便可能仍然是綠色的。沒有膽囊分泌物的糞便幾乎是無色的。使膽囊綠色然後變成黃色的東西是血紅蛋白的降解產物，這些物質使紅細胞紅色。
Why has Africa never developed,"Africa is massive. The diversity of how people live and the comparison of those lifestyles is somewhat unfair. To me, its like considering Australia undeveloped because some of the original people do not live in a modern style. Africa has many modern nations including Egypt and South Africa. In the spirit of the question though, colonization and imperialism has deeply hurt other African nations along with mineral/resource exploitationThis is a debate that still rages in the demographic community. Some say imperialism, other not so much. One important thing to note, though, is that ""Africa"" is far too big to comply to one explanation. I'm assuming you mean sub-saharran central africa, but we're still not quite sure.",為什麼非洲從未發展,非洲是巨大的。人們的生活以及這些生活方式的比較有些不公平。對我來說，就像考慮到澳大利亞沒有開發的那樣，因為有些原始人沒有現代風格。非洲有許多現代國家，包括埃及和南非。不過，本著這個問題的精神，殖民和帝國主義與礦產/資源開發一起嚴重傷害了其他非洲國家。有人說帝國主義，而不是那麼多。不過，要注意的一件重要的事情是，“非洲”太大了，無法遵守一種解釋。我假設您的意思是撒哈拉以南非洲，但我們仍然不確定。

How exactly are instincts passed on through genes?,"There are so many intermediate steps between genes and behaviors that I don't think a proper ELI5 answer is possible. But basically having one set of genes will cause an animal to have an emotional reward for acting a certain way. Having a different set of genes will cause an emotional reward for acting a different way. So while the genes themselves have no idea that they're causing their Meerkat hosts to stand watch and alert whenever they see a predator, they still get passed on more often than the genes that don't do that.Instincts are hard-wired responses to certain stimuli in your brain/nervous system. You come pre-programmed with them. Your DNA has instructions in it that automatically built certain patterns/connections in your brain. As you grow, develop and learn, other pathways and connections will be created/strengthened in your brain that were not originally in there like the instincts were. Instincts develop in a species and propagate because, over time, those organisms that had those instincts tended to be more likely to survive long enough to have offspring than those that did not have the instinct encoded in their DNA .",本能如何通過基因傳播？,基因和行為之間有太多的中間步驟，我認為不可能有適當的ELI5答案。但是基本上擁有一組基因會導致動物以某種方式行事有情感上的獎勵。擁有一組不同的基因將對採取不同的方式產生情感獎勵。因此，儘管這些基因本身不知道自己在看到捕食者時會導致梅爾卡特宿主站立和警報，但它們仍然比不這樣做的基因更頻繁地傳遞。在您的大腦/神經系統中進行某些刺激。您預先編程了它們。您的DNA有指示，即在您的大腦中自動建立某些模式/連接。隨著您的成長，發展和學習，將在您的大腦中創建/加強其他途徑和聯繫，而這些途徑和增強最初不像本能那樣。本能在某個物種中發展並傳播，因為隨著時間的流逝，那些本能的生物往往比沒有在其DNA中編碼的本能的生存時間更可能擁有足夠長的後代。
How do people tell how many people watched an episode on tv ?,"There is a company called Nielsen _URL_0_ that handles it. THey do so by distributing survey booklets in the mail and asking people to track what they watch. In larger urban markets they use special set top boxes for selected family's. There are only a few thousand such families. That's slowly changing. With the internet and video on demand the content distributors can actually tel who is watching what and when. but in terms of Cable television it's basically only Nelisen that matters.A select amount of households are chosen to be Nielson families. Their television activity is monitored. They take the data and see who watched what and other data. Then they figure out how much of America did the same, if 70% of these families watched ""NCIS"", then they can assume ~70% of the households that have televisions also watched it .Not 100% sure in the USA. But an estimate in the UK is often made by measuring the spike in energy drawn from the grid during adverts/at the end of the show from cups of tea being made. It's possible that something similar might be possible in the USA, or maybe through measuring water flow of the plumbing from toilets flushing?"", 'Randomly selected People which represent the whole society get a special device for their tv collecting the neccesary information. Online values are counting too and are getting more and more important.",人們如何告訴有多少人在電視上觀看了一集？,有一個稱為Nielsen _url_0_的公司來處理它。他們通過在郵件中分發調查手冊並要求人們跟踪他們觀看的內容來做到這一點。在較大的城市市場中，他們為選定家庭使用特殊的固定盒子。只有幾千個這樣的家庭。這正在慢慢變化。借助互聯網和視頻按需，內容分銷商實際上可以打電話給誰在看什麼以及何時觀看。但是，就有線電視而言，基本上只有Nelisen很重要。一定數量的家庭被選擇為尼爾森家庭。他們的電視活動受到監控。他們獲取數據，看看誰觀看了什麼和其他數據。然後，他們弄清楚了美國有多少人的工作，如果這些家庭中有70％觀看了“ NCIS”，那麼他們可以假設約有70％的有電視的家庭也觀看了。但是，在英國，在廣告杯結束時，通過測量從網格中抽出的能量的尖峰通常是通過製作茶杯來進行的。在美國可能有可能發生類似的事情，或者可能通過測量廁所水管的水流嗎？也很重要，而且變得越來越重要。
"Why are objects sometimes visible only from the corner of the eye, but seem to disappear when we look in that direction?","There are two types of photoreceptors in human eyes, rods and cones . Near the center of our retina we have a lot of cones so we get a lot of good visual data about color and produce a quality image of what we are looking at. As you get further from the center of the retina, the amount of cones goes down and rods goes up. This makes us really good at noticing any subtle change in shadows in the corner of our vision, so we detect movement of something that might be sneaking up on us. Rods are more sensitive to low levels of light so sometimes if it is dark you can see something out of the corner of your eye but not in the center of your vision .",為什麼有時只能從眼角看到對象，但是當我們朝那個方向看時似乎消失了？,人眼，棒和錐體中有兩種類型的感光體。在視網膜的中心附近，我們有很多圓錐體，因此我們獲得了許多有關顏色的良好視覺數據，並為我們所看的東西提供了質量的圖像。隨著您離視網膜中心的距離，圓錐體的數量下降了，桿升起。這使我們真的很擅長注意視覺角落的陰影的任何細微變化，因此我們發現可能潛入我們的事物的運動。桿對低水平的光更敏感，因此有時，如果天黑，您可以從眼角看到一些東西，而不會在視力中心。
Why does more people clapping make more noise?,"When you clap, you send out sound waves. When two sound waves meet each other, they 'interfere'. Imagine waves on water when you drop a stone into it. Peaks and troughs are formed. When a peak meets a peak, the amplitude of the wave doubles, and when a peak meets a trough, they cancel out, and the amplitude is 0. [Here is a useful picture]. Clapping causes this to happen many times, and it is this interference that means the overall sound is louder.",為什麼更多的人鼓掌會發出更多的噪音？,拍手時，您會發出聲波。當兩個聲波相遇時，它們會“干預”。想像一下，當您將一塊石頭放入水中時會在水上揮手。形成峰和槽。當峰達到峰時，波的幅度會加倍，當峰遇到槽時，它們會取消，幅度為0。[這是有用的圖片]。拍手導致這種情況多次發生，正是這種干擾意味著整體聲音更大。
How does our brain remind us about stuff?,"Well, it has to do with connections. You think ""I need to feed my dog in the morning"".

How did people clean their teeth before the invention of the toothbrush?,"Besides what u/stannywilson said, there was much less need for teeth-cleaning tools until the time of the Industrial Revolution.

Having nice breath is mentioned in a lot of contemporary texts as a very desirable attribute, and they 'd chew on anything that could offer that. Almost every household, great or small, would have a patch of garden with things growing in it that they could use to cook with, for medicine, pigments and dyes, to keep unwanted pests away or any of those important things. Mint isn't exactly hard to grow, and there's no shortage of other sweet-smelling options. In some very specific ways their oral health was actually somewhat better than ours. They ate much less sugar than we do, so decay and cavities were less common; remains that have been dug up usually show the teeth as *worn down* rather than full of holes.

How do anti diarrohea tablets work?,"As food passes through the digestive tract, it encounters first the oesophagus and stomach, where it is broken down into digestible pieces, and then passes into the small and large intestines. For the most part , the small intestine is where various nutrients are absorbed from the food at various points. Little nutrient absorption happens in the large intestine, but it is the main site of water absorbtion from the food that will eventually become stool. The consistency of the stool depends on the amount of water absorbed from the large intestine, which in turn depends on the speed that the matter passes through. If the transit speed is slower, there is more time for the bowel to absorb water and the stool is drier. Loperamide, the main anti-diarrhoea drug used in most situations, acts at some of the same receptors in the brain as heroin and morphine . When this interaction happens, it causes the brain to send a signal to the nerves controlling the muscles of the bowel which slows down their activity and reduces the transit speed of matter through the bowel, thus giving the bowel more time to absorb water and making the stool less wet and sloppy. I hope this explains things OK, any questions just shout my way and I'll try and answer! edit: a word.They slow down the muscles of the intestines which means that food passes through the intestines more slowly. The longer it takes to pass through the more water is absorbed by the intestines.",抗腹瀉片如何工作？,當食物通過消化道時，它首先遇到食道和胃，然後將其分解成易消化的碎片，然後進入小腸和大腸。在大多數情況下，小腸是各種各樣的食物吸收各種營養素的地方。在大腸中，幾乎沒有營養吸收，但它是食物中水吸收的主要部位，最終會變成糞便。糞便的一致性取決於大腸所吸收的水量，這又取決於物質經過的速度。如果運輸速度較慢，那麼腸子吸收水並且糞便乾燥的時間更高。Loperamide是在大多數情況下使用的主要抗Diarrhoea藥物，它與海洛因和嗎啡相同的受體作用。當這種相互作用發生時，它會導致大腦向控制腸道肌肉的神經發送信號，從而降低其活性並降低物質的過速速度，從而使腸子有更多時間吸收水並使水吸收水凳子濕又草率的。我希望這可以解釋一切，任何問題都會大聲喊叫，我會嘗試回答！編輯：一個單詞。它們放慢了腸的肌肉，這意味著食物通過腸道的速度更慢。通過腸吸收更多的水所需的時間越長。

Some would get more specific names What we typically call a ""fly"" is also known as the ""house fly"" and, its commonality is probably why it is the one that got to be shortened to just ""fly"" in the vernacular.not sure of the answer but the majority of insects have 4 wings: 2 fore wings and 2 hindwings. flies are the only insect order that have modified hindwings called halteres . these halteres are what allow flies to have superior agility to other insects - they act as dynamic counter-balances in flight. perhaps this has something to do with their name they're excellent fliers!!"", 'Why do we call our moon Moon when many other planets have many other moons?A little more anecdotal but it might be because pretty much all other flying insects have something else identifiable about them.Bees are the buzzy, flowery ones, wasps are the angry, stingy ones, dragonflies are the long, elegant ones, ladybugs are the pretty, spotted ones. But with flies they don't do anything else. They are teeny black specks that fly around for about a day then die. They're only ""flies"" because there's almost literally nothing else you could possibly name themGood question, OP. Now you 've got me wondering why cod aren't called ""swim"" and horses aren't called ""run"".I always thought about it once in Portuguese we have specific names for each insect and no one is named fly it's very awkward for who doesn't have English as first language ",在所有具有飛行能力的昆蟲中，為什麼將蒼蠅指定為白話名稱？,最初，所有飛行昆蟲都被稱為“蒼蠅”。有些人會得到我們通常稱為“蒼蠅”的更具體的名稱，也稱為“房屋蒼蠅”，它的共同點可能是為什麼它是為什麼要縮短的，以便在白話中只是“飛”。在答案中，但大多數昆蟲有4個翅膀：2個前翼和2個後翼。蒼蠅是唯一修改了稱為吊帶的後翼的昆蟲秩序。這些吊帶可以使蒼蠅具有較高的敏捷性與其他昆蟲的敏捷性 - 它們充當飛行中的動態平衡。也許這與他們的名字有關，它們是出色的傳單！！”，'當許多其他星球上有許多其他月亮時，我們為什麼稱我們的月球稱為月球？有點軼事，但可能是因為幾乎所有其他所有其他飛行的昆蟲對它們有其他可識別的東西。Bees是嗡嗡的，花朵般的，黃蜂是憤怒的，小ing的，蜻蜓是長而優雅的，瓢蟲是漂亮的，斑點的。但是有了蒼蠅，他們什麼也沒做。它們是十幾歲的黑色斑點，四處飛走大約一天，然後死亡。它們只是“蒼蠅”，因為幾乎沒有其他東西可以命名為他們的問題。“游泳”和馬不稱為“運行”。我總是在葡萄牙語中考慮過一次，我們有每隻昆蟲的特定名稱，沒有人被命名為fly，因為誰沒有英語作為第一語言，這很尷尬
"Certain medications warn you to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking it. Why is this, and why only grapefruit and not other citrus like apples or oranges?","Apparently this has been explained, but if you don't feel like following those links I'll try to boil it down. Grapefruit juice contains a compound that gives certain medicines a stronger effect on the body, and explaining that is probably outside the scope of this sub. In the case of blood thinners like Crestor, for instance, it can make the blood too thin, which limits the concentration of oxygen and nutrients, as well as forcing the heart to work harder for that same reason. r/askdocs would probably be a better source for a full explanation.",某些藥物警告您服用葡萄柚和葡萄柚汁。為什麼這是為什麼，為什麼只有葡萄柚和其他柑橘類（例如蘋果或橘子）？,顯然已經解釋了這一點，但是如果您不想遵循這些鏈接，我會嘗試將其煮沸。葡萄柚汁含有一種化合物，使某些藥物對人體產生更強的作用，並解釋可能超出了該潛子的範圍。例如，對於諸如Crestor之類的血液稀釋劑，它會使血液過於稀薄，這限制了氧氣和養分的濃度，並且由於同樣的原因而迫使心臟更加努力。R/AskDocs可能是完整解釋的更好來源。
Why exactly does wetting paper make it softer and more prone to tearing? What physical property of paper is affected?,"The bonds of the paper combine with the water, making them less bound to each other. Which is not only why it is easier to rip, but also when paper dries back out, it never looks the same. Here is a more technical answer i grabbed: Paper is mostly made from cellulose fibres . Cellulose molecules bristle with hydroxyl groups, and these form hydrogen bonds with each other. It's these hydrogen bonds that make the individual fibres stiff, and also hold the fibres together. Water is also full of OH bonds, obviously since it's H22O, and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that cellulose molecules form with each other. There are two results from this: firstly the cellulose fibes in the paper become floppy, because their internal hydrogen bonds are broken, and secondly the fibres separate from each other more easily. The combination of these two effects makes paper easier to tear apart when wet. Most organic materials show similar behaviour. For example cotton is also easier to tear when wet . Also hair becomes floppier and more easily damaged when wet, though the effect is less pronounced because hair contains fewer hydrogen bonds than cellulose fibres.",為什麼濕紙到底使它更柔軟，更容易撕裂？紙的哪些物理特性受到影響？,紙張的鍵與水結合，使它們彼此之間的約束程度較小。這不僅是為什麼它更容易撕裂的原因，而且當紙張乾燥時，它看起來永遠不會相同。這是我抓取的更具技術性的答案：紙主要由纖維素纖維製成。纖維素分子與羥基刷毛，它們彼此形成氫鍵。正是這些氫鍵使單個纖維變硬，還將纖維固定在一起。水也充滿了OH鍵，顯然是因為它是H22O，並且水分子與纖維素上的羥基形成氫鍵，這破壞了纖維素分子相互形成的氫鍵。有兩個結果：首先，紙張中的纖維素纖維變軟，因為它們的內部氫鍵被損壞，其次，纖維更容易彼此分離。這兩種效果的結合使紙在濕時更容易撕裂。大多數有機材料表現出相似的行為。例如，濕時棉布也更容易撕裂。同樣，濕時頭髮會變得易於變形，並且更容易受到損壞，儘管其效果不太明顯，因為頭髮含有比纖維素纖維更少的氫鍵。
why you can never remember the start of a dream only the middle through to the end,"Often there isn't a start to the dream, you just think there is. You find yourself injected into the middle of some scenario, and your brain builds vague false memories to try to explain why you are there. For example, you might start your dream driving in a car. You wonder where you are, and your brain says, ""um, South Dakota?"" You ask why South Dakota, and your brain ""remembers"" that you had to meet someone from work there. You dream doesn't contain any of those actual events, just a fuzzy recollection they must have happened otherwise, what the hell are you doing in South Dakota?', ""You dream in your short term memory.

What caused the Latin language to become a dead language when older languages like Greek or Icelandic stay alive?,"Italian is just what Latin became in Italy, as French is what it became in France and Spanish is what it became in Spain.

Why do ATMs run Windows?,"Maybe *better* but certainly not *cheaper*. In general, WinXP is used because of the reduced development costs.

"What's the difference between The Beatles ""Let it Be"" (Original) and ""Let it Be...Naked""?","*Let It Be* was the second-to-last Beatles album recorded. They never finished working on it, though, and moved on to record *Abbey Road*. Note that by this point the band was pretty dysfunctional - nobody really liked anyone, there were a lot of lawsuits over Apple Records, etc. They broke up soon after. Work on *Let It Be* was completed by producer Phil Spector who added a lot of overlays to the album. *Let It Be Naked* is the original Beatles version of the album, without all that stuff added. So most of the songs are a lot simpler - which was the original intent for that album . **EDIT**: this is a very simplified explanation, as I didn't want to make this a long lecture.",甲殼蟲樂隊“讓它成為”（原始）和“讓它成為……赤裸裸”有什麼區別？,*讓它*是錄製的二次甲殼蟲專輯。但是，他們從未完成工作，並繼續記錄 *Abbey Road *。請注意，到目前為止，樂隊非常功能失調 - 沒有人真正喜歡任何人，在Apple Records等上有很多訴訟。製作人Phil Spector完成了 * Let * Be *的工作，他在專輯中增加了很多疊加。*讓它赤裸裸*是專輯的原始版本，而沒有添加所有這些內容。因此，大多數歌曲都更簡單 - 這是該專輯的最初意圖。**編輯**：這是一個非常簡化的解釋，因為我不想讓這句話很長。

Is plastic pollution still a problem if I properly dispose/incinerate all my trash?,"Incineration generates a ton of air pollution or toxic waste so I’m not sure if that can be considered a solution or “proper”There is no proper way to incinerate plastic trash. As others have pointed out, it creates a lot of toxic gasses as it burns. There's also not really an objectively ""proper"" way to dispose of it, either. Plastic doesn't typically biodegrade in a reasonable timeline. Most plastic will take millennia to biodegrade, so burying it in a landfill only delays the problem and creates another set of problems - namely, you have to spend energy to haul it to the landfill, then more fuel to cover it. The main thing they're considering is that 100% compliance is not feasible. There will *always* be people who are lazy, ignorant, or just plain vindictive and won't properly dispose of their plastic trash. And there's no way to police an entire population, when there are so many *many* vectors for them to both acquire plastic trash and drop it. Instead, it's much easier to stop it at the source. If no one is allowed to hand out disposable plastic items that will become trash, you don't have to police the rest of the populationBeyond just waste, creation of plastics involves petroleum, and the more we can get away from that, the better for everyone. One plastic bag takes as much petroleum to produce as it would take to drive a car about 11 meters.Burning up plastic causes a ton of pollution.

How doe home owner associations have any power?,"Most people who are under HOA rules got that way when they bought the house and agreed to the rules of the HOA. You sign a contract and so they can enforce that contract. You also agree that if you sell the house you will require the buyer to sign that contract in order to buy the house.It's one of the contingencies in a home sale contract. There is a list of things that the seller must disclose to the buyer of a house before the contract is signed. One of those is a contract from the H/POA or Condominium operator. It varies state to state, but generally they has a given window of time to present the rules and regs/fees/etc to the potential buyer. If the buyer does not find them agreeable, it's actually one of the few things you can walk out of a home sale contract on. If you do not agree to the terms, you don't buy the house. Sometimes to rules not only cover what goes on while you live there, but also what happens if you sell it. My wife and I are house shopping now and there are a number of different POAs we've looked into and some go as far as saying if you try to sell, you have to first put it up on a private POA only listing for like 45 days before putting it on the open market. Furthermore, even if the buyer agrees to the POA agreement, they can still deny the sale. Not entirely sure the legal grounds there, but there ya go.

How did English become such a prominent language?,"1) England had several waves of colonization--from settling North America to settling Australia and New Zealand to conquering India to conquering much of Africa . At the peak, the [British Empire ruled 1 in 4 people on earth], by far the biggest empire in history. 2) England didn't just go around conquering people--they were a massive commercial power . In the early 19th century, if you wanted people who knew how to build a railroad or a telegraph or a factory, you needed to deal with Englishmen. In the late 19th century industry had spread, but if you wanted access to the top financial markets, you needed to deal with Englishmen. 3) This wealth and technology meant lots of research; if you wanted to keep up on the latest science or technology in your field, you needed to keep up on English-language journals. 4) In the 20th century, England's position slipped. But England's global dominance was inherited by the USA, so English remained the language of international commerce, diplomacy, and scholarship. 5) The USA was also a cultural powerhouse; English-language books, movies, and TV help spread the language.One of the largest and most prominent commercial empires of all time with world-spanning influence happened to speak English, and everyone learned English to trade with them or trade through their routes. Their empire basically fell apart over the first half of the 20th century, but their successor happened to also speak EnglishColonialism.

How can Social Security be in trouble when people pay through a Social Security tax to fund it.,"Well, its a little more weird and complex than that. First, you are paying in but the people who currently need it are drawing on your funding of it. As will you from the people who pay after you. Second, the politicians love to tweak things and they made a few major tweaks. Here is one: the capped the contribution. I believe its capped at $150,000 a year but it doesn't matter really - here is the point: If you make above the cap you only pay into social security based on the cap. So, if you make 1 million a year you pay the same as someone who makes only $150,000 a year. This is an example of how people with an agenda of privatizing S.Sec. underfund it so they can argue that it is going to fail so we have to privatize it.

"Why do coupons always say ""cash value 1/20 of one cent"" or something similar?","During the early 1900s, stores had trading stamps, where for every dime you spent at the store, you got a stamp, and when you saved enough stamps, you can mail in those stamps for free merchandise . These stamps were HUGE business back in the day. But merchants had to pay the stamp makers for the stamps and that payment increased prices of goods, custumers who didn't collect stamps thought that the price increase was unfair so Congress passed a law saying that the stamps had to have cash value so that customers can redeem them directly with the merchant for money (thereby offsetting the increase in good prices.. And the 1/20 of one cent was a considered a fair price back in the early 1900s. In certain states, coupons are still considered trading stamps, so by law, they have to include the disclamer.",為什麼優惠券總是說“一分錢的現金價值1/20”或類似的內容？,在1900年代初期，商店有貿易郵票，在商店裡度過的每一角錢，您都會得到一張郵票，當您保存足夠的郵票時，您可以免費郵寄這些郵票以免費商品郵寄。這些郵票當天是巨大的生意。但是商人不得不向郵票製造商支付郵票，並且付款提高了商品的價格，未收集郵票的託管人認為價格上漲是不公平的，因此國會通過了一項法律，說這些郵票必須具有現金價值，以便客戶可以用商人直接兌換他們（從而抵消了良好價格的增長。。因此，根據法律，他們必須包括迪斯蘭國。
How does fridges or freezers work?,"Have you ever held a can of compressed air while you pressed the trigger? The can gets really cold. When compressed gas is released the container cools. Imagine a loop of pipe. There is a very small valve on one side and a pump on the other. The pump pressurizes the coolant. The valve creates the same reaction of pressure being released. So the side where the pressure is released is cold, but the side with the pump is hot. That's why they put the hot pump on the outside . And the cold valve on the inside.",冰箱或冰櫃如何工作？,按下扳機時，您是否曾經舉行過壓縮空氣？罐子真的很冷。釋放壓縮氣體時，容器冷卻。想像一下管道循環。一側有一個很小的閥門，另一側有一個泵。泵將冷卻液加壓。閥產生與釋放壓力的相同反應。因此，釋放壓力的側面很冷，但是帶泵的側面很熱。這就是為什麼他們將熱泵放在外面的原因。和內部的冷閥。

Why are most third world countries in warmer areas of the world?,"There was a scientific trend in the past called Material Determinism that attempted to explain that the tropical regions were not as developed for reasons such as being warmer and thus making people lazy. This theory has been discredited a long time ago. There is no causation, even if there is some correlationTo be fair, in their time Egypt and Rome were first world superpowers.Because tropical climates are better suited for agriculture. You don't need advanced infrastructure. You need fields and cheap labor. So when the Europeans started colonizing Africa & the New World, they didn't invest in schools, higher education or pushing the native populations into an urban lifestyle. They kept them poor and out in the fields. The trend has continued with a very few wealthy elite keeping the status quo set up by Europeans. That is a very gross & condensed version of European expansionism and its continued effects but gets the gist across.",為什麼大多數第三世界國家都在世界較溫暖的地區？,過去存在一種科學趨勢，稱為物質決定論，試圖解釋熱帶地區的發展不是因為溫暖，從而使人們懶惰。很久以前，這種理論已被抹黑。沒有因果關係，即使有一些公平的相關性，埃及和羅馬是第一世界超級大國。因為熱帶氣候更適合農業。您不需要高級基礎架構。您需要領域和廉價的勞動力。因此，當歐洲人開始殖民非洲和新世界時，他們沒有投資學校，高等教育或將土著人口推向城市生活方式。他們使他們保持貧窮，並在田野裡。這種趨勢一直在繼續，很少有富有的精英使歐洲人建立的現狀。這是歐洲擴張主義及其持續影響的非常粗糙和凝結的版本，但要越來越多。
"Does our brain ""render"", or ""run"" dreams in ""real-time""?","Your external senses are connected to specific centers in your brain that process the external signals and create the conscious sensation of seeing, hearing etc. These would be the ""renderers"". When you're imagining, dreaming or hallucinating, it means that an internal signal from your brain is stimulating those areas to create the sensation. For instance, you can visualize an image in your mind because it's stored in your memory as a stimulus that, when run into your visual cortex, recreates the sensation of seeing that image. When you do this consciously, you know that it's just a mental image and not a real one. But when you're dreaming/hallucinating, you usually can't consciously differentiate, so you have the impression it's a real image.",我們的大腦在“實時”中是否“渲染”或“實現”夢？,您的外部感官與大腦中的特定中心相連，這些中心處理外部信號，並產生有意識的觀察，聽力等。這些將是“渲染器”。當您想像，做夢或幻覺時，這意味著您大腦的內部信號正在刺激這些區域以產生感覺。例如，您可以在腦海中可視化圖像，因為它將其存儲在您的內存中是一種刺激，當遇到視覺皮層時，會重新觀察該圖像的感覺。當您有意識地做到這一點時，您就會知道這只是一種心理形象，而不是真實的形象。但是，當您做夢/幻覺時，您通常無法自覺地區分，因此您的印像是真實的形象。
How can mass excape a black hole?,"From my limited understanding I present you this. A black hole has an event horizon, as you know. This is a line that, when crossed, there is no return - even for light. Now all around us there is empty space, a ridiculous amount of it. You are more empty space than you are atoms when it comes down to it. That empty space is theorized to be bustling with energy. Little bits of energy are snapping into existence in pairs , arching away and then back to meet their counterpart and fizzling out. The radiation a black hole emits is based on these principles combined. The theory is that when those bits of energy form on the event horizon one of them is pulled into the black hole, thus never meeting and negating it's counterpart - which then floats off into space and becomes theoretically detectable energy. This is known as Hawking Radiation.I think you may be asking about Hawking Radiation. Simply put: if a particle/anti-particle pair form as a result of a random quantum fluctuation on the black hole's point of no return , then one may fall in and the other may escape. If you're interested in learning more, then the term you want to Google/Wikipedia is ""hawking radiation"". Edit: so sorry. I just re-read your question and see you were asking about particles coming from the poles . That's not what I was describing.

What's the controversy on fluoride in tap water?,"Essentially, fluoride was discovered to be an element that helps protect the teeth against acid, sugar, and other things that wear them down. It's very cheap and simple to add to the water supply, and it's harmless in reasonable quantities. Fluoride is also present in toothpastes and mouthwashes for this reason. So governments around the world decided to add it to the public water supply, protecting every person's teeth and reducing pain, medical costs, disease, etc for little cost and effort. It also strengthens bones generally and protects against things like osteoporosis, although the doses in public water supplies are so low that this isn't a very pronounced effect -- usually your doctor would give you much higher doses if you needed that protection. Fluoride at high doses can be dangerous. Fatal dosages for adults begin at around 5 grams, which is equivalent to about 5,000 litres/1,320 gallons of normally fluoridated water in one day . At lower doses, it can cause swelling and pain in joints. Fluoride does occur naturally in many groundwater supplies, sometimes at doses high enough to cause that swelling and pain . Some people found it scary that the government would add something to the water supply, and the idea that fluoride is actually used to make people passive, brainwashable, etc is a popular conspiracy theory. There's no evidence that fluoride has any mental effects, though, and adding fluoride to water supplies hasn't been associated with any social change other than a decrease in dental problems.",自來水中氟化物的爭議是什麼？,"從本質上講，發現氟化物是有助於保護牙齒免受酸，糖和其他使其磨損的物質的元素。添加到供水非常便宜且簡單，並且合理數量無害。由於這個原因，氟化物也存在於牙膏和漱口水中。因此，全世界政府決定將其添加到公共供水中，保護每個人的牙齒，減少疼痛，醫療費用，疾病等，幾乎沒有成本和精力。儘管公共供水中的劑量如此之低，以至於這不是很明顯的效果 - 通常，如果您需要保護的話，這也不是很明顯的效果，它也可以加強骨骼並預防諸如骨質疏鬆症之類的東西。高劑量的氟化物可能很危險。成人的致命劑量始於5克約5克，相當於約5,000升/1,320加侖的正常氟化水。在較低劑量下，它會導致關節腫脹和疼痛。氟化物確實在許多地下水供應中自然發生，有時以足夠高的劑量引起腫脹和疼痛。有些人發現政府會為供水增加一些東西而令人恐懼，而氟化物實際上被用來使人們被動，可洗腦等的想法是一種流行的陰謀論。但是，沒有證據表明氟化物具有任何心理影響，除了減少牙齒問題外，還沒有與任何社會變化相關的氟化物。"
"Why don't sharks, fish, and other aquatic animals need to equalize whenever they ascend or descend through water?","They do. Swim bladders in fish expand and contract- bring a fish up from depth quickly and the swim bladder will swell up. If there's too much swelling it will be damaged and so will the fish.This is a complex question. Humans can get 3 major problems when diving. 1) the bends , 2) nitrogen narcosis , 3) barotrauma .The air we breathe is mostly nitrogen but our body doesn’t use it . That’s why most of the problems relate to nitrogen as opposed to oxygen or carbon dioxide.When you go down to depth, air is compressed by the pressure. In other words, the molecules of air are packed tighter together. So more of them will fit in your lungs and sinus. When you come up, they expand and cause barotrauma. Similarly, more molecules will dissolve in your blood, at depth, high nitrogen levels make you feel drunk and when you come up, they come out of the blood in bubbles which damages nerves. Sea creatures like seals and whales are mammals that can descend quickly and come up and breathe the air just as we do. However they have adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the change. Their lungs compresses . That way, their lungs cannot explode when they come up . It also eliminates the store of extra nitrogen that could potentially be absorbed in the blood to cause nitrogen narcosis. The ones that have sinuses have large Eustachian tubes that keep the sinus the same pressure as the outside world . Fish, don’t have lungs or sinuses or they have other adaptive mechanisms . The general answer would be, that they have a series of adaptive mechanisms that prevent barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis and the bends.",為什麼鯊魚，魚類和其他水生動物不需要在水上上升或下降時都需要均衡？,他們是這樣。魚類中的游泳膀胱擴張和收縮 - 迅速將魚從深度抬起，游泳膀胱會膨脹。如果腫脹過多，它將損壞，魚也會受到破壞。這是一個複雜的問題。潛水時人類可能會遇到3個主要問題。1）彎曲，2）氮毒性，3）Barotrauma。我們呼吸的空氣主要是氮，但我們的身體不使用它。這就是為什麼大多數問題與氮或氧化二氧化碳相反。當您深入深度時，空氣會被壓力壓縮。換句話說，空氣的分子擠在一起。因此，更多的人會適合您的肺和竇。當您出現時，它們會擴展並引起Barotrauma。同樣，更多的分子會溶於您的血液，深度，高氮水平使您感到醉酒，當您出來時，它們會從泡沫中散發出損害神經的血液。海豹和鯨魚等海洋生物是可以迅速下降並像我們一樣呼吸空氣的哺乳動物。但是，它們具有自適應機制來彌補這一變化。他們的肺部壓縮。這樣一來，他們的肺部就無法爆炸。它還消除了可能在血液中吸收的額外氮儲存，從而引起氮麻醉。那些鼻竇具有大的尤斯塔克式管，可以使鼻竇與外界保持相同的壓力。魚，沒有肺或鼻竇，或者它們具有其他適應性機制。一般的答案是，它們具有一系列的適應性機制，可防止壓抑，氮性麻醉和彎曲。

"Why do many gay men talk with a lisp, or have a feminine tone in their voice?","I might get crucified for this post. Anyway, as a gay person with a mild gay tone I suppose in a *sense* I do it ""because I want to"" but it honestly is mostly subconscious because I can't stop without intensely conscious effort. My tone actually differs depending on whom I'm talking to. If it's a very masculine guy, I will feel feminine around him and use a feminine voice. If I'm around most females or a very fem guy I'll use a more masculine tone. Again, though, I don't really realize I'm doing it. So in my opinion, it has a lot to do with ideas about sexual roles and masculinity, and may be linked to why gay men prefer men sexually. Of course though, there are gay men who have masculine voices and are even submissive in bed, but I have not met many. Typically, the more submissive you can get even a dominant gay guy, the more likely he is to use a more feminine, gentler, or higher tone. I hope this isn't offensive to those who object to my saying ""feminine"" voices sound that way, but it probably will be. Oh well.They're identifying themselves by adopting an easy to observe trait which is outside common gender roles.",為什麼許多同性戀者與LISP交談，或者他們的聲音中有女性化的語氣？,我可能會在這篇文章中被釘在十字架上。無論如何，作為一個具有溫和同性戀語氣的同性戀者，我想在“感覺”上 *我這樣做。我的語氣實際上取決於我與誰交談。如果這是一個非常男性的人，我會在他周圍感到女性化並使用女性的聲音。如果我周圍大多數女性或一個非常女性的男人，我會使用更男性化的語氣。再說一次，我並沒有真正意識到我正在這樣做。因此，我認為，這與有關性角色和男性氣質的想法有很大關係，並且可能與男同性戀者更喜歡男人的原因有關。當然，有些男人有男性的聲音，甚至在床上順從，但我沒有遇到很多。通常，您越順從，您甚至可以獲得一個占主導地位的同性戀者，他就越有可能使用女性化，更溫和或更高的語氣。我希望這對那些反對我說“女性化”的聲音的人不會冒犯性，但這可能是。哦。

Breast cancer has by far the most money put into advertising so more people know about it and more people put money into it. Sadly a lot of that money goes into organizations that are really just hangers on to the whole issue. You've got people who contribute nothing or next to nothing to breast cancer treatment and research but do plenty of advertising for it so they can accept donations.Because it ranks 3rd in cancer mortalities. Funding is not equally distributed and is more based on the number of people affected and how deadly it is. This question is like asking why do we have vaccines for the flu but not the common cold, for example.",為什麼乳腺癌幾乎得到了重點和支持；雖然無數其他癌症被公開忽略了？,更好的公關。在更大的情況下，我們都很淺，無知。迄今為止，乳腺癌是廣告投入的最多的資金，因此人們對此有更多了解，並將更多的人投入其中。可悲的是，很多錢進入了整個問題上實際上只是衣架的組織。您已經有一些人對乳腺癌治療和研究一無所有任何貢獻或幾乎沒有任何貢獻，但為此做了很多廣告，以便他們可以接受捐款。因為它在癌症死亡中排名第三。資金不是平等分配的，而更多地基於受影響的人數和致命。這個問題就像問為什麼我們要接受流感疫苗，而不是普通感冒。
why are release dates for movies so far apart in different countries?,"I think it depends on the popularity of the movies, too. Block busters in my country are often released within one week",為什麼在不同國家的電影相距很遠？,我認為這也取決於電影的受歡迎程度。我國家的街區剋星通常在一周內發布
Why do pens work when you doodle with them to try and get them to work but don't if you actually use it.,"Amount of use. When you start writing and it doesn't work, you've drawn a line a centimetre long or roundabout before you stop. When you then start doodling to get it to work, you are scribbling rapidly, and if you laid it out that line would be much, much longer. That long line gives the ink time to settle, gravity to do its work and the pen to start writing again. If you just continued writing, if they are going to work, they would, it would just take a while.",當您塗鴉時，為什麼筆來嘗試讓它們工作時，但如果您實際使用它，則不會工作。,使用量。當您開始寫作並且不起作用時，您就在停止之前繪製了一條厘米長的或迴旋處。然後，當您開始塗鴉以使其正常工作時，您正在迅速塗抹，如果您列出了它，那條線就會更長。這條長線使墨水有時間安定下來，重力進行工作以及筆重新開始寫作。如果您只是繼續寫作，如果他們要上班，他們會的，那將需要一段時間。
Why does a USB drive need to be safely removed but a SD card doesn't?,"I'm pretty sure they both need to be safely removed, otherwise you risk removing the drive during a writing operation, thus corrupting the files.",為什麼需要安全地刪除USB驅動器，而SD卡則沒有？,我很確定他們都需要安全地刪除它們，否則您有可能在寫作操作期間刪除驅動器，從而破壞文件。
What happens when you reach the end of the universe? What if you try to go further?,"there is no end of the universe . everywhere is the center, or nowhere is the center depending on how you want to phrase it. there is, however, the edge of the observable universe. but if you physically approach it, it just moves along with you. think of yourself on a ship on the ocean. you can see the horizon x miles away. but you don't approach the edge of the world as you sail, the horizon just keeps moving along.",當您到達宇宙末端時會發生什麼？如果您嘗試進一步走怎麼辦？,宇宙沒有終點。到處都是中心，或者無處不在的中心，具體取決於您想如何用語。但是，有可觀察到的宇宙的邊緣。但是，如果您實際接近它，它就會與您一起移動。在海洋上的船上想想自己。您可以看到Horizon X遠處的地平線。但是，當您航行時，您不會接近世界的邊緣，地平線一直在繼續前進。
"If ""the oceans are running out of fish"" why doesn't the price of fish go up significantly? (or at all?)","A lot of fish are overfished, and are considered commercially extinct, but not extinct as a species. Meaning there are insufficient stocks of fish to continue harvesting them. And as the food chain changes, because we've destroyed a layer of the food chain, a different species may take that position and make it permanently impossible for the original species to recover. The price of fish has gone up, farmed fish are helping replace that. For example, [Atlantic cod] is almost impossible to buy at market. Current harvests are about 1% of what was previously caught. Same goes for haddock, red drum, and a few others. White abalone is almost extinct, in 1980, it was about $2/lb, before the fishery was closed in 1995, it was selling for almost $15/lb. You should consider, it's cheaper now to grow farmed striped bass in the middle of the Arizona desert than it is to fish them in the oceans. That gives you a hint as to the scale of the problem.",如果“海洋耗盡魚”，為什麼魚的價格不高？（或者一點？）,很多魚被過度捕食，被認為在商業上被視為一種物種，但並非滅絕。這意味著沒有足夠的魚類繼續收集它們。隨著食物鏈的變化，由於我們已經破壞了食物鏈的一層，因此不同的物種可能會採取該立場，並使原始物種永久地恢復。魚的價格上漲了，養殖的魚正在幫助取代它。例如，[大西洋鱈魚]幾乎不可能在市場上購買。當前的收穫約為以前被捕的1％。黑線座，紅鼓和其他一些人也是如此。白鮑魚幾乎滅絕了，1980年，漁業於1995年關閉之前，大約是2美元/磅，其售價近15美元/磅。您應該考慮的是，現在在亞利桑那州沙漠中間種植養殖條紋的低音要便宜，而不是在海洋中釣魚。這給了您有關問題規模的提示。
Why do our brains seem to have specific receptors just for drugs?,"A better question is: why are there drugs for every set of receptors? And that's because molecules can take so, so, so, so, *so* many shapes that for every receptor there are bound to be some molecules that lock on the receptors [a little bit] and some that lock on to the receptors [very, very, very strongly]. And men find these, or make them, and they use them, and then they are drugs. The receptors came about through evolution, or else through creation, if you prefer, because they were beneficial to organisms' survival; they were interacted with by endorphins and other chemicals that already exist in your head in small quantities). And those drugs that occur naturally, as in those many, many drugs found in plants and fungi, often occurred through evolution because they were beneficial to the plants/fungi's survival - often by intoxicating animals who would consume the plant sufficiently to dissuade them from doing so. Men who make new psychoactive drugs generally don't make them weaker, but stronger - so this is a case where the natural drugs are indeed likely to be less harmful than the artificial ones.",為什麼我們的大腦似乎只有用於藥物的特定受體？,一個更好的問題是：為什麼每組受體都有藥物？那是因為分子可以這樣做，因此，因此， *如此 *的形狀，以至於每個受體必然會有一些分子鎖在受體上[有點]，有些則鎖定在受體上[非常非常，非常非常強烈]。男人找到了這些，或者製造它們，然後使用它們，然後是毒品。如果您願意的話，受體是通過進化或否則創造而產生的，因為它們對生物的生存有益。它們是由少量存在的內啡肽和其他已經存在的化學物質與其他化學物質相互作用的）。那些自然發生的藥物，就像在植物和真菌中發現的許多藥物一樣，通常是通過進化而發生的，因為它們對植物/真菌的生存有益 - 通常是通過陶醉的動物來使植物充分消耗植物以使其無法做到的動物。所以。製造新的精神活性藥物的男人通常不會使它們變得更虛弱，而是更強壯 - 因此，這種情況確實可能比人造藥物更有危害。
Why is it that only hatchbacks/SUVS have a rear windshield wiper when they're the ones that need it the least?,"They aren't the ones who need it the least if you think about dirt. Cars with a trunk and a more angled rear window will see more rain hit the window, but cars with a flat rear end will see maximum air pressure pushing up dirt/grime into the back of the car. For this reason, these cars often have rear windshield wipers.. for the dirt that is more likely to accumulate, etc.. not necessarily for the rain.",為什麼只有掀背車/SUV才有後擋風玻璃刮水器，而當他們需要它的雨刷器最少的雨刮器？,如果您考慮污垢，他們不是最需要它的人。帶有後備箱和更傾斜的後窗的汽車將看到更多的降雨撞到窗戶，但是平坦的後端汽車將看到最大的氣壓將污垢/污垢推入汽車後部。因此，這些汽車經常有後擋風玻璃刮水器..對於更可能堆積的污垢等。不一定是雨。
On what bases are scores awarded in gymnastics? Why was Nadia Comaneci the first to get a perfect 10?,"In general, most routines/exercises start with a ""base score"" of 10. Judges then deduct fractions of points from the score for various mistakes during the routine. The more severe the mistake, the larger the deduction. A score of ""10"" means the judges identified no mistakes in the execution of the routine. The difficulty of a particular routine/element also matters, as judges are more forgiving of mistakes in difficult elements, and harsher on mistakes during easy elements. Now, as to why Nadia Comaneci was the first to do it, that's a rather subjective question. Mostly, it was a reflection of how much better she was than everyone else at the Olympics that year. She actually earned seven ""10""s during that Olympics over the course of the games, 4 times on uneven bars, and 3 times on balance beam.The rules for scoring gymnastics get pretty complicated and seem to change every few years but routines are graded for difficulty and points are removed for even the tiniest mistakes. The gymnast or his/her coach submits a copy of the routine to the judges who calculate the difficulty score and then points are deducted from another score, the execution score, during the routine based on mistakes. The two scores are added together for the final score. Certain skills are mandatory in a routine but doing harder versions of those skills lead to a higher score as long as the gymnast can actually perform them. A gymnast performing a difficult routine with a few small mistakes will get a higher score than someone performing an easier routine perfectly. It's not a perfect system but grading anything artistic comes with some problems. Just look at figure skating.",在什麼基礎上是在體操中授予的分數？為什麼納迪亞·科曼奇（Nadia Comaneci）是第一個獲得完美10的人？,通常，大多數例程/練習都以10個“基本分數”開頭。法官在例程期間從分數中扣除分數的分數。錯誤越嚴重，扣除量就越大。得分為“ 10”是指法官在執行程序執行時沒有犯錯。特定的例行程序/元素的困難也很重要，因為法官更寬容了困難元素中的錯誤，並且在簡單的元素中對錯誤更加嚴厲。現在，關於為什麼納迪亞·科曼奇（Nadia Comaneci）是第一個這樣做的人，這是一個相當主觀的問題。通常，這反映了她在那年奧運會上比其他所有人要好得多。實際上，在奧運會上，她在奧運會期間贏得了七個“ 10”，在不平坦的酒吧和平衡光束上獲得了4次。得分體操規則變得非常複雜，似乎每隔幾年就會發生變化出於困難，即使是最細微的錯誤，也會刪除積分。體操運動員或他/她的教練向法官提交了一份例行程序的副本，後者計算了難度得分，然後在例行程序中根據錯誤而從另一個得分（執行得分）中扣除得分。將兩個分數添加在一起以獲得最終分數。某些技能在日常工作中是必不可少的，但是只要體操運動員實際上可以執行這些技能，這些技能的努力就會提高得分。與表演更輕鬆的例行程序相比，一名遇到一些小錯誤的體操運動員會獲得一些小錯誤。這不是一個完美的系統，但是對任何藝術品進行分級都帶來了一些問題。只看花樣滑冰。
Why was a red clown chosen to be the mascot of McDonalds?,"Willard Scott, whom you may know best as *The Today Show*'s weatherman up until 1996 , performed as Washington, D.C.'s Bozo The Clown from 1959 to 1962. In 1963, McDonald's approached him about creating a mascot that would appeal to kids. Due to his experience as Bozo, Scott created a character he dubbed, ""Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger Happy Clown"" ). In 1966, Michael Polakovs was hired to redesign the clown into the modern look with which most people are familiar. In the early 1970s, when Sid & Marty Krofft's shows, such as HR Pufnstuf, became popular with kids, McDonald's marketing team started using ""McDonaldland"", from where the characters such as Grimace, Mayor McCheese, Hamburglar and others originated. [Sid & Marty Krofft sued McDonald's], and the Kroffts were awarded more than $1 million. The case was also notable for standardizing legal tests for similarity in copyright law.The clown wears red, white and gold because these are the McDonalds colours. Golden arches on a red field with the name in white. The clown is intended to appeal to kids, at least it did before it became 'a thing' to be afraid of clowns.",為什麼選擇紅色小丑作為麥當勞的吉祥物？,威拉德·斯科特（Willard Scott）直到1996年，您可能最了解 *今日秀 *的天氣預報員，從1959年至1962年以華盛頓特區的小丑（The Clown The Clown）演出。孩子們。由於他是Bozo的經驗，斯科特創造了一個他稱為“漢堡快樂小丑的羅納德·麥克唐納”的角色。1966年，邁克爾·波拉科夫斯（Michael Polakovs）被聘請將小丑重新設計為大多數人熟悉的現代外觀。在1970年代初，當Sid＆Marty Krofft的節目（例如HR Pufnstuf）在孩子們中受到歡迎時，麥當勞的營銷團隊開始使用“麥當勞”，從麥當勞，麥克唐納（McCheese），市長麥克切斯（McCheese），漢堡（Hamburglar）和其他角色等角色開始。[Sid＆Marty Krofft起訴麥當勞]，Kroffts被授予超過100萬美元。該案件也是標準化版權法中相似性的法律測試的標準化。小丑穿著紅色，白色和黃金，因為這些是麥當勞顏色。紅色田地上的金拱門，名稱為白色。小丑的目的是吸引孩子，至少在害怕小丑的“事物”成為“事情”之前。
Why do dog's do that little moonwalk on grass after they pooped on it?,"They're using their feet to release chemicals that mark their territory.

Why is it so difficult to get manned craft to the moon nowadays but it was possible several times in the 1960's and 70's?,"It was always difficult in that it takes a tremendous feat of engineering. It is still difficult and also very costly. It isn't a matter of having not been able to, it's a lack of will and funding.",為什麼如今很難將載人的工藝登上月球，但在1960年代和70年代可能有幾次？,總是很難，因為它需要一項巨大的工程壯舉。這仍然很困難，而且非常昂貴。這不是無法做到的問題，這是缺乏意志和資金的問題。
moving between parallel universes (mild spoilers: stranger things),"It's very difficult to discuss because ""parallel universes"" can mean a whole bunch of different phenomena. In almost all cases, though, moving from one Universe to another would require an additional ""direction"" in which to move beyond the ones we experience in our universe. At the moment, there is no evidence that such a direction exists, and even if there is I don't think that we could expect to be able to access it ourselves. Beyond that it's not really possible to comment further, I don't think. It's hypothetical at so many levels that, while I wouldn't want to rule out the possibility entirely, it would be a very long time indeed before we would be able to take it seriously as something other than science fiction.",在平行宇宙之間移動（溫和的破壞者：陌生的事物）,很難討論，因為“平行宇宙”可能意味著一大堆不同的現象。但是，在幾乎所有情況下，從一個宇宙轉移到另一個宇宙都需要一個額外的“方向”，以超越我們在宇宙中所經歷的方向。目前，沒有證據表明存在這樣的方向，即使我認為我們無法期望能夠自己訪問它。除此之外，我認為不可能進一步評論。這在許多層面上是假想的，以至於我不想完全排除可能性，但確實很長一段時間，我們才能夠將其認真對待科幻小說以外的其他東西。
