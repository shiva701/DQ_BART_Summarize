"The Hubble telescope was launched in 1990. Since our technology has advanced tremendously since then, wouldn't it be advantageous to send a more advanced telescope up there?","We have. The Chandra X-Ray telescope has been in orbit for a decade or so. As for the Hubble, it's been repeatedly serviced and upgraded, with the most recent service mission in 2009. Indeed, many if not most of the major instruments on the Hubble are from the past decade.",哈勃望遠鏡於1990年推出。由於我們的技術自那時以來一直在進行巨大的發展，因此在那裡發送更先進的望遠鏡會不會有利嗎？,我們有。Chandra X射線望遠鏡已經在軌道上了十年左右。至於哈勃人，它已被一再維修和升級，並在2009年進行了服務任務。的確，哈勃人的大多數主要樂器（如果不是大多數）來自過去的十年。
Could a computer be built out of electromagnetic relays instead of semiconductors?,"Yes. The only issue would be the sheer size and power requirements of the relays limiting the capabilities of the computer - along with their slow switching time and low reliability. A modern processor effectively switches billions of times a second. A relay would struggle to go above a couple of hundred. Modern transitors are nanometers wide so even a 'small' computer implimented electromechanically will be the size of a decent warehouse or two and be much less powerful computationally than your phone. That, and the tendency for bugs to literally get jammed in them. Still, they were good at what they were supposed to do.",電腦可以由電磁繼電器而不是半導體構建嗎？,是的。唯一的問題是繼電器限制計算機功能的巨大尺寸和功率要求，以及它們的慢速切換時間和低的可靠性。現代處理器每秒有效地切換數十億次。接力賽將難以超越幾百。現代運輸量是納米寬的，因此即使是“小型”計算機在機電上強加的計算機都將是一個不錯的倉庫的大小，並且比您的手機強大的計算功能要小得多。那，以及蟲子從字面上被困住的趨勢。儘管如此，他們還是擅長應該做什麼。
Why do we so often read about legislation that was 'snuck through' attached to another Bill and why is this practice still allowed?,"Legislative bodies write their own rules. That is the simple answer. Loopholes are allowed. Lobbyists love them. Some legislatures allow bills to be passed with the promise that the text will be inserted laterThe legal system is like when you're playing pretend ninjas with your friend and he always makes new rules so that he never loses. ""I dodged that!"" ""I'm immune to electricity!"" ""You didn't see me, I'm invisible!""",為什麼我們經常讀到有關另一個法案附帶的立法，為什麼仍然允許這種做法？,立法機構撰寫自己的規則。那是簡單的答案。允許漏洞。遊說者愛他們。一些立法機關允許通過法案，並承諾將稍後插入文本，就像您與朋友一起假裝忍者時，他總是製定新的規則，以免他從不失敗。“我躲過了！”“我免受電力！”“你沒看到我，我看不見！”
Where do presidential campaign donations actually get spent? And where do any leftover funds go after a candidate drops out/loses?,"Advertising mostly. The funds are used to run campaign offices, buy materials like pamphlets, air time for ads, travel expenses, etc It's very expensive to campaign every day for a year or two. Afterwards, the left over money generally goes to the party the politician is a member of. The actual laws about it are all over the board, and I don't know them nearly well enough to discuss them here.",總統競選捐款實際上在哪裡？在候選人退出/丟失後，剩餘的資金在哪裡？,廣告主要是。這些資金用於經營活動辦公室，購買小冊子，播放廣告，旅行費用等材料，每天一兩年的活動都非常昂貴。之後，左派金錢通常去政黨是一個成員。關於它的實際法律遍布整個董事會，我對它們的了解幾乎不足以在這裡討論。
How/Why are queen insects such as ants and wasps so much bigger than the normal ones. Are they a different species or just lucky with genes?,"When bees are in need of a new queen, whether due to an unexpected death or an aging queen, the worker bees sense this is happening and will begin making new queens. The workers will begin chemically secreting ""royal jelly"", which is the honey-like product with hormones and other signals necessary for a queen to form. A larvae that was previously fated to become a drone will then be built into a larger cell, filled with Royal Jelly, and grow larger than a drone to become a queen. They don't have special genes or anything, they are simply larvae that have the capacity to become a queen under the right conditions: And have had those conditions given to them. A similar process exists for ants and other ""royal"" hive insects.Why? Because it allows them to store male sperm and produce offspring more often and efficiently, as they're the only ones in a colony doing that. They're not a different species, all ants within a colony are from the same species. The difference lies in their roles and generation. The Queen will be the oldest insect in a colony, being the mother. All other ants in a colony are infertile daughters of the queen ! The only exception is when they occasionally lay a male or fertile female which will soon leave the colony to start its own colony.",螞蟻和黃蜂等女王崑蟲比普通昆蟲大得多。它們是不同的物種還是對基因的幸運？,當蜜蜂需要一個新的女王時，無論是由於意外死亡還是衰老的女王，工人都會感覺到這正在發生，並將開始製造新的皇后。工人將開始化學分泌“皇家果凍”，這是類似蜂蜜的產品，具有激素和女王形成所需的其他信號。然後，一個以前被註明成為無人機的幼蟲將被內置在一個較大的牢房中，裡面裝滿了皇家果凍，並且比無人機大得多，成為女王。它們沒有特殊的基因或任何東西，它們只是幼蟲，在正確的條件下有能力成為女王：並且已經給予了這些條件。螞蟻和其他“皇家”蜂巢昆蟲也存在類似的過程。為什麼？因為它使他們能夠更頻繁有效地存儲男性精子並產生後代，因為它們是殖民地中唯一這樣做的人。它們不是不同的物種，菌落中的所有螞蟻均來自同一物種。不同之處在於他們的角色和世代。女王將是殖民地中最古老的昆蟲，是母親。殖民地中的所有其他螞蟻都是女王的不育女兒！唯一的例外是，當他們偶爾躺下一個雄性或肥沃的雌性時，這很快就會離開殖民地開始自己的殖民地。
What is the point of the standard deduction in tax returns?,"The Congress created the standard deduction in 1944 to make tax filing simpler for most Americans. Rather than keep receipts and fill out complex paperwork to file for dozens of specific deductions, the standard deduction allowed a taxpayer to just reduce his/her taxable income by 10%. The Congress in 1964 changed the deduction to a dollar amount, so as to permit the poorest Americans to avoid paying taxes altogether. The deduction still serves those dual purposes today -- making filing simpler for most Americans, and eliminating tax liability for the poorest Americans. _URL_0_",納稅申報表的標準扣除額的重點是什麼？,國會在1944年制定了標準扣除額，以使大多數美國人更簡單。標準扣除額並沒有保留收據並填寫複雜的文書工作以申請數十種特定扣除額，而是使納稅人只能將其應稅收入減少10％。1964年的國會將扣除額提高到一美元，以便使最貧窮的美國人避免完全繳稅。扣除額今天仍然適用於這些雙重目的 - 使大多數美國人更簡單地提出歸檔，並消除了最貧窮的美國人的稅收責任。_url_0_
Why in dreams do we run extremely slow or can not punch with much force?,"I remember this question from years ago and found the thread. I reworded it and hopefully this makes sense: You're brain is not able to get ""feedback"" from the motion your performing because a part of your brain clamps down on motor signals while sleeping. You need this because it generates ""data"" for comparison and corrective purposes. It feels slowed and bogged down because you're not actually able to perceive what's happening in the dream. Oppositely, you 've never flown before, so you don't actually need feedback to ""correct"" yourself and tell your brain if you're wrong or not. _URL_0_ Edit: This happens to me, but it isn't the case for everyone. It's way more complicated than thisIt depends on the dreamer. These things do not happen to me in my dreams. It is what YOUR subconscious decidedIn the real world, the sensation of running or punching is highly dependent on physical feedback, your feet pounding on the pavement, your fist sinking into a punching bag. Dreams have only the sensations your brain imagines, and without a physical world to provide feedback, it imagines those sensations less wellThose are anxiety dreams. Those are basically the same as dreams about missing homework or teeth falling out or whatever is appropriate for your life stage. (Although I kept having school related dreams for a good 7 or 8 years after college.I think it's like when you see a dog trying to bark or run in his sleep. He's dreaming about doing doggy stuff and his brain is still trying to tell his body to move, but since he's asleep he can only move a little bit. To me it feels like like my brain can only give a fraction of the signal my muscles need to actually move, and in my dream state I interpret this as me being very weak or slow like you said.",為什麼在夢中我們跑得非常慢，還是不能用太多力量打孔？,我記得幾年前的這個問題，並找到了線程。我對此進行了重新介紹，希望這是有道理的：您的大腦無法從您的表演中獲得“反饋”，因為您的一部分大腦在睡覺時會夾在運動信號上。您需要此需要，因為它為比較和糾正目的生成“數據”。感覺很放緩和陷入困境，因為您實際上無法感知夢中正在發生的事情。相反，您從未飛行過，因此您實際上不需要反饋來“糾正”自己，並告訴大腦是否錯了。_URL_0_編輯：這發生在我身上，但每個人都不是這樣。這比這更複雜，取決於夢想家。這些事情在我夢中沒有發生。這是您的潛意識在現實世界中確定的，跑步或打孔的感覺高度取決於身體反饋，腳在人行道上敲打，拳頭沉入一個打孔袋中。夢想只有您的大腦所想像的感覺，沒有提供反饋的身體世界，它可以想像那些感覺較少的感覺是焦慮夢。這些基本上與缺少家庭作業或牙齒掉下來或適合您一生階段的夢想相同。（儘管我在大學畢業後的7或8年裡一直在與學校相關的夢想。我認為這就像您看到狗試圖吠叫或睡覺時。他的身體移動，但是由於他睡著了像您所說的那樣非常虛弱或慢。

How do apps like soundhound and shazam know what song is playing?,"ELI5: Think about when you hear your parents, you can recognize their voice right? Or when you see a dog, you can recognize it's a dog in general. Now what kind of dog? You can typically recognize it's a chihuahua or, my fav, a golden retriever. How? Chihuahuas are small and annoying with short hair, whereas a golden retriever is cute, cuddly, friendly, with long hair . In the same way, Shazam and Soundhound does that! They take a look at features of a song, like the pitch, tone, or waveform and try to match it to a song in their memory.",像Soundhound和Shazam這樣的應用程序如何知道在播放什麼歌曲？,ELI5：想一想，當您聽到父母的聲音時，您可以識別他們的聲音嗎？或者，當您看到狗時，您可以意識到這是一條狗。現在什麼樣的狗？您通常可以識別它是奇瓦瓦州或我最喜歡的金毛獵犬。如何？奇瓦瓦人很小，煩人的短髮，而金毛獵犬可愛，可愛，友好，長發。同樣，Shazam和Soundhound也這樣做！他們查看歌曲的功能，例如音調，音調或波形，並試圖將其與他們的記憶中的歌曲相匹配。

"Why is it illegal to advertise tobacco on television, but not alcohol?","Because people passed laws against one and not the other. I'm sure we could go back and forth all day about the merits of such laws, the relative harm caused by each one, things that are deemed ""culturally-acceptable,"" the role of money and lobbyists, etc. But the truth is that there is no good answer like, ""Because kids don't want to drink."" The anti-tobacco people got that law passed, and the anti-alcohol people haven't.",為什麼在電視上宣傳煙草而不是酒精是非法的？,因為人們通過了針對一個而不是另一個法律。我敢肯定，我們可以整天來回探討此類法律的優點，每個法律所造成的相對傷害，被認為是“文化上可以接受”的事物，金錢和遊說者的作用等等。但是事實是沒有一個好的答案，例如“因為孩子們不想喝酒。”反菸民人民通過了這項法律，抗酒精飲料人沒有。
"Why do candidates have to be labeled by party? Wouldn't eliminating this labels ensure that people vote more on policies and the person, rather than just blindly for their party?","The party system makes it easier for politicians to run for office without having to explicitly state their stance on different topics. The politicians know that the voters will make assumptions based on party affiliation. The candidates have to belong to one of the two major parties because our political system is designed so that power only changes hands between these two powerhouses. Eliminating the party system would be a great thing but in order for that to happen, the politicians who belong to the two major parties would have to approve of it and that will never happen. Political parties are one of the things that George Washington warned everyone about when he left office. He warned that allowing money into politics and having a party system would corrupt the electoral process and the gov't, and that's exactly what has happened.It's similar to saying ""Why don't we eliminate brand names and just choose the best product?"" Voters don't always get access to all the information about particular candidates. Party labels help voters makes it easier for voters to select a candidate that best aligns with their values. Perhaps ideally, a person would sit down and analyze all of a presidential candidate's positions, but are you really going to do that for senator, governor, lt. governor, representative, state rep., state senator, etc. all the way down the ticket? Most voters won't, so party labels help them to make the best possible decision by giving them some general information.",為什麼候選人必須由政黨標記？是否會消除這些標籤，確保人們對政策和人的投票，而不是為他們的政黨盲目投票嗎？,政黨制度使政客更容易競選公職，而不必明確陳述其對不同主題的立場。政客們知道，選民將根據黨派的隸屬關係做出假設。候選人必須屬於兩個主要政黨之一，因為我們的政治制度的設計是這樣，使權力只在這兩個強國之間改變了手。消除政黨制度將是一件很棒的事情，但是為了實現這一目標，屬於兩個主要政黨的政客必須批准它，這將永遠不會發生。政黨是喬治·華盛頓（George Washington）何時離開辦公室時警告大家的事情之一。他警告說，允許金錢進入政治並建立政黨制度會破壞選舉過程和政府，而這正是發生的事情。這類似於說：“為什麼我們不消除品牌名稱並選擇最佳產品？“選民並不總是能訪問有關特定候選人的所有信息。黨的標籤幫助選民可以使選民更容易選擇最適合其價值觀的候選人。也許理想情況下，一個人會坐下來分析總統候選人的所有職位，但是您真的要為參議員，州長，中尉做到這一點。州長，代表，州代表，州參議員等。大多數選民不會，因此黨的標籤通過提供一些一般信息來幫助他們做出最佳決定。

Why do we have freckles?,"Think of human DNA as an instruction manual called ""How to build a human."" The instructions get copied over and over and sometimes mistakes are made or instructions get lost entirely . Somewhere in my genome are the instructions about ""how to create a chemical called melanin"" Also in my genome are missing or incorrect instructions about ""how to use melanin as a hair and skin pigment"" So my body is able to produce the pigment, but it doesn't produce enough, and/or doesn't know how to use it properly and evenly throughout my body. It's not only freckles. The hair on top of my head, my eyebrows, and my beard, are all different colors. I once had a hair stylist complain ""that's not how they taught us melanin works!"" Although I would quite expect them to cover this exact topic in hair stylist school so she must have not been paying attention on ginger dayThe gene MC1R originally coded for high melanin content of cells which would give dark skin, but as humans left Africa and their skin color shifted the gene changed into one which periodically will code for freckles, likely due to some very complex genetic interaction. Basically it is an intermittently varied functioning of our previously black skin genes.",我們為什麼有雀斑？,將人類DNA視為一種指示手冊，稱為“如何建立人”。說明一遍又一遍地複制，有時會犯錯誤或說明完全丟失。我基因組中的某個地方是關於“如何創建一種稱為黑色素”的說明，我的基因組中也缺少或不正確的說明“如何使用黑色素作為頭髮和皮膚色素”，因此我的身體能夠產生色素，但是它不會產生足夠的產生，並且/或不知道如何在我的整個身體中正確均勻地使用它。這不僅是雀斑。我頭頂上的頭髮，眉毛和鬍鬚都是不同的顏色。我曾經有一位髮型師抱怨說：“那不是他們教給我們黑色素的工作方式！”儘管我非常希望他們在髮型師學校中涵蓋這個確切的話題，因此她一定在Ginger Day上不關注Gene MC1R最初編碼的細胞高黑色素含量，這會給您帶來深色皮膚，但是當人類離開非洲及其皮膚時顏色轉移了基因變為一個，它會定期為雀斑編碼，這可能是由於某些非常複雜的遺傳相互作用。基本上，這是我們以前黑色皮膚基因的間歇性功能。

"The difference between downloading and uploading, why is uploading typically so much slower? Why can't the server just ""download"" from the client?","The server is downloading from the client but the ISP only provides you a certain amount of upload speed as part of the terms of your service. Just the same way they offer multiple different download speeds depending on how much you pay. Because most people use a lot less upload than download they don't provide as much. Customers aren't particularly demanding, and let's the isolate the more valuable business customers who might want to run things like servers a lot more from the residential service plans.The physical support of the network have limited bandwidth. This ""maximum amount of information that can be transmitted by unit of time"" affects the signals going in both directions. Bandwidth is divided in channels which are then assigned to end users.

Why does tequila have such a bad reputation?,"There are many reasons, but two stand out. 1. The quality of cheap tequila is awful. Mexican regulations allow tequila to be as little as 51% ""real"" tequila and the rest can be made from other stuff. And some people claim the impurities give them a bad hangover.2. Tequila is often used by people who are drinking way too much alcohol and way too little water, so the next day they feel sick and they blame the tequila.

"Symmetry makes a face pretty, what makes a voice pretty?","Timbre. It's the property that give non-pure tones, such as human voice, its unique character with harmonic overtones and undertones. Most everyone can say or sing in the same frequencies, but they'll all sound different due to physical differences and techniques. Those differences give timbre to the sound. Because the human brain is very good at picking up patterns, it finds harmonious sound pleasing compared to dissonant sounds in a similar way that brain prefers symmetrical facial features to a facial feature that looks 'off'. On the side note, preference to symmetrical face is also due to correlation between genetic abnormality and/or upbringing environment and face symmetry, which has some influence in attracting mates. Preference in certain vocal qualitities may also be related to that.Your voice identifies you as uniquely as your looks and your fingerprints do. Although some people might sound quite a bit alike, no two voices are ever exactly alike.We each have a unique voice because so many factors work together to produce that voice. Your voice starts down in your lungs, where air is exhaled to create an airstream in the trachea and across the larynx, which is often called the voice box.Stretched horizontally across your larynx are vocal folds, which are also known as vocal cords. As air passes over them, the vocal cords vibrate very quickly to produce sounds. The higher the rate of vibration, called frequency, the higher the pitch will be. The pitch of your voice is largely determined by the length and tension of your vocal _URL_0_ themselves, the vocal cords produce just a buzzing sound. The parts of your body between the vocal cords and the outside world, such as the throat, nose, and mouth, act as a resonating chamber to turn those buzzing sounds into your unique human voicePhysically: cricothyroid , diaphragm, jaw, and tongue control.

"- If drain water gets recycled, why is it harmful to waste water down the drain?","It takes a lot of fancy machines to turn any old water from a river or a drain into pure clean water for drinking.

Some places have water meters in homes and you get charged for how much water you use, so then it's your own money you're wasting. There are natural sources of pure water, such as springs where water flows out of porous rocks, but they can't provide enough for how many people there are nowadays.", - 如果排水水被回收，為什麼將水浪費在排水管上是有害的？,將河中的任何舊水或排水管變成純淨的清水以飲用需要很多高檔的機器。這些機器需要花錢來建造和繼續工作，這基本上就是浪費的錢。有些地方的房屋中有水錶，您會因使用多少水而受到費用，因此這是您自己浪費的錢。有天然的純水來源，例如彈簧，其中水從多孔的岩石中流出，但是它們無法為當今有多少人提供足夠的服務。
"Why haven't we added a centrifugal (false gravity) element to the ISS, and does it even matter?","In addition to the answers above, a large part of why the ISS exists is to conduct experiments in zero gravity.Well you need a fairly large and symmetrical ship to make it feasible. The ISS is not designed to rotate in a stable fashion, it's not designed with a particular 'down' in mind , fuel to get it rotating is more expensive cargo, it's not big enough , NASA hasn't done much in the way of research on 'effects of long term spinning on the body' , and so on.",為什麼我們不在國際空間站中添加一個離心元素（錯誤的重力）元素，這甚至重要呢？,除了上面的答案外，ISS存在的原因很大一部分是進行零重力進行實驗。嗯，您需要一艘相當大且對稱的船以使其可行。ISS的設計並非以穩定的方式旋轉，它的設計並不是考慮到特定的“下降”，旋轉的燃料更昂貴，它不夠大，NASA在研究方面沒有做太多事情關於“長期旋轉對身體的影響”，等等。

"How does 'the cloud' make Xbox One games faster, stronger, better?","An aside to what the others said the cloud computing they talk about is Windows Azure. Windows Azure is basically an infrastructure that allows many instances of Windows to be spun up to do some tasks. Xbox Live is hosted on Windows Azure, and essentially Microsoft are saying Azure is getting better, more stable, so we are cranking up the nozzle a little bit to allow Azure to spin up even more instances of Windows, so the workload is spread even more and it allows for more users. They will offload even more shit onto Azure, because it's faster. It'll send a request up to a Azure virtual machine, which is a customised Windows Virtual machine , and this means your Xbox can handle more local stuff, like allocating more power and resources to your games.All that it does is put some of the computing power in the ""cloud"" and not from the console itself. This can have 2 advantages over just Console Computing: _URL_0_ allows you to create persistent worlds, like an MMORPG, that exist even when your console is turned off. And _URL_1_ can handle some of the more minor computing that typically happen in the background, thereby giving your console more power to render things in real time, since it doesnt have to multitask. For example take Skyrim. You can have all of the current action handled by the console, while the cloud could render characters, dialogue and backgrounds that you don't really come into contact with, to make the world seem more ""alive"" and vibrant.",“雲”如何使Xbox One遊戲更快，更強，更好？,除了其他人所說的雲計算是Windows Azure。Windows Azure基本上是一種基礎架構，允許許多Windows實例旋轉以完成一些任務。Xbox Live託管在Windows Azure上，從本質上講，Microsoft說Azure越來越好，更穩定，因此我們稍微提高噴嘴，以允許Azure旋轉更多的Windows實例，因此工作負載擴散得更多。它允許更多用戶。他們會在Azure上卸下更多的狗屎，因為它更快。它將向Azure虛擬機發送請求，該機器是一種自定義的Windows虛擬機，這意味著您的Xbox可以處理更多本地內容，例如將更多的功率和資源分配給您的遊戲。“雲”中的計算能力，而不是來自控制臺本身。這可以比主機計算具有2個優勢：_url_0_允許您創建持久世界，例如MMORPG，即使關閉了控制台，也存在。_url_1_可以處理通常在後台發生的一些更小的計算，從而為您的控制台提供了更多的實時渲染功能，因為它不需要多任務。例如，以天際為例。您可以通過控制台處理所有當前的動作，而云可以呈現您並未真正接觸的角色，對話和背景，以使世界看起來更加“活著”和充滿活力。
What actually happens when we recall music or sound?,"Music Educator here!People learn to speak by repetition, right? This is the same way you learn lyrics and melodies to your favorite songs or even songs you don't know well. I don't know about you, but if I hear a song I like, j loop it until I'm sick of it completely. So what happens is your brain makes sequencing connections with what you know comes next in a song. Sometimes it takes a while for your brain to keep up with the mass amount of information a song can contain considering things like melodies, countermelodies, harmonies, and lyrics. Eventually it just ingrains itself in your memory because your mind is used to hearing it.Recall is triggered by outside stimuli even if you can't pinpoint the exact thing that queued a song to stick in your brain. Someone speaking to you may talk in a certain octave that is similar to a song and your mind will take that as the queue to collect all the data you've stored relative to that specific sound. After that, it's just your mind's voice reiterating the sequence of sound it knows comes next! I hope that helped. If I didn't explain well enough, let me know!",當我們回想起音樂或聲音時，會發生什麼？,音樂教育者在這裡！人們通過重複學習講話，對嗎？這是您學習自己喜歡的歌曲甚至您不太了解的歌曲的歌詞和旋律的方式。我不認識你，但是如果我聽到我喜歡的歌曲，請播放它，直到我完全討厭它。因此，發生的事情是您的大腦與您所知道的接下來會在歌曲中進行測序連接。有時，您的大腦需要一段時間才能跟上歌曲可能包含的大量信息，例如旋律，反模板，和聲和歌詞。最終，它只是在您的記憶中就會陷入困境，因為您的思想習慣於聽到它。與您交談的人可能會在某個類似於歌曲的八度音階中說話，而您的思想將以這一排隊方式收集相對於該特定聲音存儲的所有數據。之後，這只是您的思想重申接下來知道的聲音順序！我希望有幫助。如果我解釋不夠好，請告訴我！
What is preventing Taiwan from becoming its own country? As of right now is it considered to be part of China?,"After World War 2, a communist revolution occurred in China and the previous ruling government in China escaped to Taiwan. At the time, the Chinese revolutionaries were incapable of assaulting Taiwan and the United States continued to recognize this government as the legitimate government of all of China, but this didn't stop the revolutionaries from declaring victory and laid claim to all lands owned by the ousted government, including Taiwan. These circumstances didn't change much for a while, but eventually the US decided that they needed to move on and aknowledge the new Chinese government officially, but they would have no contact with the US unless they aknowledged China's full borders, including Taiwan. The US agreed as long as the Chinese didn't make too much of a fuss over the US defensive support of Taiwan from military invasion and independent trade with Taiwan. We are left with the result where everybody officially recognizes that Taiwan is part of China, but everybody trades with Taiwan as an independent country and the US militarily protects Taiwan from China.",是什麼阻止台灣成為自己的國家？截至目前，它是否被認為是中國的一部分？,第二次世界大戰後，中國發生了共產主義革命，中國的前統治政府逃到了台灣。當時，中國革命者無法襲擊台灣，美國繼續承認該政府是整個中國的合法政府，但這並沒有阻止革命者宣布勝利，並向所有土地宣稱所有土地。罷免的政府，包括台灣。這些情況有一段時間沒有太大的變化，但是最終美國決定他們需要繼續前進並使新中國政府正式進行知識，但是除非他們知道包括台灣在內的中國的全部邊界，否則他們將不會與美國聯繫。只要中國人對美國對台灣的防守支持和與台灣獨立貿易的防守支持，美國同意。我們的結果是，每個人都正式認識到台灣是中國的一部分，但是每個人都以台灣為獨立國家，美國軍事部隊保護台灣免於中國。
why do some companies limit online services in certain countries?,"If a company is restricting services, it is generally either because they cannot carry out those services in that area , it is simply too expensive to carry out their services in that area or it is not legal. With Netflix in particular, the right to stream a certain program is bought per region / country. So if Netflix USA buys the right to air Supernatural, that doesn't mean Netflix in France has those same rights. Often what happens is that rights to air in particular regions have already been contracted out to other services, or that they are asking a higher price than Netflix is willing to pay for those rights, so Netflix doesn't / cannot acquire them.",為什麼有些公司限制某些國家 /地區的在線服務？,如果公司正在限制服務，通常是因為他們不能在該領域執行這些服務，那麼在該領域執行其服務太貴了，或者是不合法的。尤其是Netflix，每個地區 /國家 /地區都購買了播放某個程序的權利。因此，如果Netflix美國購買了AIR Supernatural的權利，這並不意味著法國的Netflix擁有相同的權利。通常情況下，特定地區的空中權利已經與其他服務簽訂了簽約，或者他們要求的價格高於Netflix願意為這些權利支付的價格，因此Netflix不會 /無法獲得這些權利。
babies crying pre-sedentary/having shelters if it would technically be a death sentence attracting predators in nature,"Hardly. First, remember that babies were not left unattended. Our early ancestors carries their babies around constantly. Babies that are worn cry much less because pretty much their every need are very close by. Additionally, we are a species that lives in groups. A group of humans is going to be loud in any situation, and the occasional baby cry is not going to add much to that. Living in a group was our protection already, not stealthHuman infants were rarely without shelter, even during the hunter-gatherer nomadic phase humans lived in camps and caves. Infants were also never left alone. There were always adults around to attend to their needs and protect them from predators. This is one of the reasons that humans live in groups.Predators don't want to tangle with a bunch of hunter-gatherers, whether or not they are in a shelter. Humans are scary, and predators in general tend to go for isolated young or old individuals. Also, in mobile societies the babies spend a whole lot of time on their mothers, either in arms or wrapped on. They tend to cry a lot less when being held.There are no predators in nature that will attack a group of humans . Heck, there are very few that will even attack a single adult human. The few predators that are actually bigger and stronger than humans also understand the concept of strength in numbers.",如果從技術上講這是一個死亡判決，那是在自然界吸引掠食者,幾乎不。首先，請記住，嬰兒並沒有無人看管。我們的早期祖先不斷帶嬰兒。磨損的嬰兒哭得少得多，因為幾乎所有的需求都非常接近。此外，我們是一種生活在群體中的物種。在任何情況下，一群人都會大聲，偶爾的嬰兒哭泣不會為此增加太多。生活在一個小組中已經是我們的保護，即使在狩獵採集者游牧階段人類生活在營地和洞穴中，也不是隱形的嬰兒很少沒有庇護所。嬰兒也永遠不會獨自一人。總是有成年人滿足他們的需求並保護他們免受捕食者的侵害。這是人類生活在小組中的原因之一。預告人不想與一群狩獵採集者糾結，無論他們是否在庇護所裡。人類是可怕的，一般來說，掠食者傾向於孤立的年輕人或老年人。同樣，在流動社會中，嬰兒在武裝或包裹的母親身上花費大量時間。他們在被拘留時往往會少哭很多。自然界中沒有掠食者會攻擊一群人。哎呀，很少有人會攻擊一個成年人。實際上比人類更大，更強大的掠食者也了解數字的力量概念。
Can't supercomputers that crack codes be easily stopped by preventing the number of attempts done?,"Generally step one is stealing the password file so that guesses can be done locally.If I were trying to brute-force your Reddit account sure, Reddit servers can and no doubt have been configured to detect an egregious number of log in attempts.

Encrypting a file is like putting a padlock on it; there's nothing with decision making capability there to recognize a brute-force attempt. I'm free to do whatever with it as fast as my computer can manage.You must distinguish between passwords and data that's actually encrypted. If you're talking about brute-forcing a username/password-based account, the servers generally do refuse many attempts at entering a passwords. For servers that don't refuse this, the accounts are probably not worth hacking. If you mean actual ecryption, you generally deal with just data. Data can't ""refuse"" to be cracked.

What are the advantages/disadvantages of royalty vs. equity deals for start up companies on Shark Tank?,"> Why is 1 deal strictly worse than the other, how did you do the math to figure it out? Equity is ownership in the company. If they pay $100,000 for 5% of the company they will break even at the point the company is worth $2 million. But as the company becomes more valuable their profit isn't capped at any value; conceptually they could make millions if the company is successful. They also get to vote on the composition of the board, the company owes them a legal obligation to treat their investment with due care, etc. If the CEO spends the $100,000 on hookers and blow then they can sure for recompense. On the other hand a royalty is a simple capped loan. They can't make back much more than the $100,000 because the deal ends then, so if they still 20 million units they still only make a dollar from the first 100,000. They don't get to vote on the board members or the direction of the company, and they have no legal recourse if the management acts without regard to their financial investment. And finally if the company fails to sell units they can't turn around and sell off the assets of the company to make their money back. It doesn't really need much in the way of calculations to see why the royalty is much worse than equity.",對於鯊魚坦克的創業公司而言，特許權使用費與股權交易的優勢/缺點是什麼？,">為什麼1的交易嚴格比另一個差，您是如何進行數學來弄清楚的？股權是公司的所有權。如果他們為5％的公司支付100,000美元，即使在公司價值200萬美元的那一刻，他們也會破產。但是，隨著公司變得越來越有價值，他們的利潤並不是任何價值上限。從概念上講，如果公司成功，他們可以賺取數百萬美元。他們還可以對董事會的組成進行投票，該公司欠他們一項法律義務，可以通過適當的護理來治療其投資，等等。另一方面，特許權使用費是簡單的上限貸款。他們的回報遠遠超過了100,000美元，因為交易結束了，因此，如果他們仍然有2000萬輛，他們仍然只賺了100,000美元。他們不會對董事會成員或公司的方向進行投票，如果管理層不考慮其財務投資，他們就沒有法律追索權。最後，如果該公司未能出售單位，他們將無法轉身出售公司的資產以返還資金。它實際上並不需要太多的計算方式來了解為什麼特許權使用費它比公平差得多。"

"How come looking directly at the sun damaged our eyes, but seeing it in our peripherals doesn’t?","Light entering the eye is focused most directly on the fovea which is the focal point of the eye and where the center of your vision always is.

It's too intense to look directly at it but way off to the side you can usually tolerate it for a bit longer.

; How do graphics get better over time?,"There's basically two main races, both are still in motion. To make super crazy graphics, you need power. The better the graphics, the more power. Graphics processing power increases at an incredible rate, but there's still almost unlimited room for improvement on how much you can throw at the problem. To make super crazy graphics, you also need technique. Graphics began as brightness on a screen. Black bit, white bit, monochrome. Techniques improved to where we could render colour as well. Magic. Then techniques improved to where we could have moving images. Supermagic. Keep winding forward and eventually you can have a computer understand how to output 3D images, and so on and so forth.

I can run a PC (or Linux) VM on a mac. Why can't I run a MAC VM on a PC? Or can I?,"AFAIK there is no hardware/technical reason why you could not do so. Apple's own restrictions, both legal and imposed-technical, are what stop you. I think that from Apple's point of view, allowing Mac OS on VMs would hurt their Mac sales, and they are not wrong. People do try at getting Mac OS to run on non-Apple machines , but doing so violates the licensing and, again, AFAIK, is illegal.",我可以在Mac上運行PC（或Linux）VM。為什麼我不能在PC上運行Mac VM？還是可以？,Afaik沒有硬件/技術原因您不能這樣做。蘋果自己的限制是合法的和被施加技術的限制，這阻止了您。我認為，從蘋果的角度來看，允許在VM上允許Mac OS會損害其MAC的銷售，並且沒有錯。人們確實試圖讓Mac OS在非蘋果機上運行，但是這樣做違反了許可，而AFAIK再次是非法的。
Why couldn't we have develop computers to understand human language rather than binary?,"Because the entire basis of binary is a physical property. The entire basis of electronic computing was the transistor. A transistor is like a see-saw; it's either on or off, on being conductive and off being non-conductive. Ergo, binary was used as an abstraction of this: 1 is on, 0 is off. Making a physical switch with 26+ different positions is extremely difficult, and lends to many problems. With a transistor, it is easy to tell what position it is in. With a 26-place switch, it's much more difficult. Programming languages and compilers are what we made in order to turn our human language into language that the computer can understand.",為什麼我們不能開發計算機來理解人類語言而不是二進制語言？,因為二進制的整個基礎是物理屬性。電子計算的全部基礎是晶體管。晶體管就像遠見。它是開關的，是在導電和關閉無導體時。Ergo，將二進制用作以下的抽象：1 on，0關閉。用26個以上的不同位置進行物理切換非常困難，並且可以解決許多問題。有了晶體管，很容易分辨出它的位置。使用26個接收的開關，這要困難得多。編程語言和編譯器是我們為將人類語言變成計算機可以理解的語言而製定的。

Why do companies such as Nintendo region lock certain products? What exactly is region locking?,"Nintendo region locks their consoles for a few reasons. One is cultural differences; for example in Bravely Default the Japanese versions' costumes are much skimpier and the characters are younger whereas when it was localised for the West they were aged up and were given more 'modest' clothing. Nintendo also doesn't bother localising every single Japanese game for the West because the game or franchise might be: * unpopular or not very well-known* confusing to Western audiences* considered 'inaproppriate' for the West or impossible to localise in a way that would make sense to non-Japanese audiences Thus they are region locked so there is no confusion; these games aren't translated into English anyways so unless you are a fluent Japanese speaker and reader living in the US there would be no reason for you to really want to play these games. There are also economic reasons; in places like Australia even popular games are pretty expensive and if there were no region locking there would be no reason for them not to import US games for cheaper than it would be to buy Australian games. Licensing and copyright issues are also an issue that region locking deals with. I don't think Nintendo plans to remove region locking any time soon, but I believe some popular 3DS hacker has devised a way to bypass region locking on the 3DS.",為什麼Nintendo地區等公司鎖定某些產品？區域鎖定到底是什麼？,任天堂地區由於幾個原因鎖定了遊戲機。一種是文化差異；例如，在勇敢的默認情況下，日本版本的服裝更加濕潤，角色年輕，而當它本地化為西方時，它們已經老化，並給予了更多“適度”的服裝。任天堂也不會為西方的每一個日本遊戲而定位，因為遊戲或特許經營可能是：*不受歡迎或不太著名的*與西方觀眾感到困惑*被認為是西方的“ inaproppratiate”，或者不可能以某種方式定位這對非日本觀眾來說是有意義的，因此它們是被鎖定的地區，因此沒有混亂。無論如何，這些遊戲都沒有翻譯成英文，因此除非您是一個流利的日語說話者和居住在美國的讀者，否則您沒有理由真正想玩這些遊戲。也有經濟原因；在像澳大利亞這樣的地方，甚至流行的遊戲都非常昂貴，如果沒有區域鎖定，就沒有理由讓他們不會以便宜的價格進口我們的遊戲，而不是購買澳大利亞遊戲。許可和版權問題也是地區鎖定的問題。我認為任天堂沒有計劃盡快刪除區域鎖定，但我相信一些受歡迎的3DS Hacker已經設計了一種繞過3DS鎖定區域的方法。

why it is a good idea or bad idea to buy 1 share of every single stock in the stock market,"If you wish to buy 'one of everything' in the market, your best strategy is to buy a fund based on some index that contains 'everything'. A good example is an S & P 500 fund, which is actually composed of 500 select large US companies, but is representative of 'everything in the market'. The Russell 3000 is another that has 3000 companies, 98% of the investible stock market. Reason #1. Transactions cost. I can buy $100 or $100,000 worth of a fund through my online brokerage account for $7, and I could probably get it cheaper. Buy individual stocks at $7 each would cost quite a bit more. Reason #2. Diversity. Your strategy is probably intended to limit risk of a single company failing. Share prices are different: one share could be $5, most are between $20 and $70, many are over $200. Do you really want five times as much Facebook as you do Bank of America ? Apple recently did a 'reverse split', changing the price of a share from $900 to $90: would you then sell 90% of your stock for that reason? You might consider an equally weighted portfolio , but that doesn't solve the transactions cost problem.Because berkshire stock is 100k+ at the moment",為什麼在股票市場購買每股1股是一個好主意或壞主意,"如果您想購買市場上的“所有東西”，那麼您最好的策略是根據包含“一切”的指數購買基金。一個很好的例子是標準普爾500指數，實際上由500家精選的美國公司組成，但代表了“市場上的一切”。羅素3000是另一家擁有3000家公司的公司，佔可投資股市的98％。原因＃1。交易成本。我可以通過我的在線經紀帳戶購買價值100美元或100,000美元的資金，價格為7美元，而且我可能會更便宜。每人以7美元的價格購買個人股票的成本要多得多。原因2。多樣性。您的策略可能旨在限制單個公司失敗的風險。股價不同：一股可能是5美元，大部分在20美元到70美元之間，許多股份超過200美元。您真的想要美國銀行的五倍嗎？蘋果最近進行了“反向分裂”，將份額的價格從900美元更改為90美元：然後您會出於此原因出售90％的股票嗎？您可能會考慮一個同樣加權的投資組合，但這並不能解決交易的成本問題。因為目前伯克希爾股票為100k+"

Why can't common grass be used as grain? Isn't everyone (who lives on suburban property) growing some food?,"It comes down to yield of the good stuff - the grain. Yes, cereal wheats etc. are technically grass, but over the thousands of years humans have been selectively growing and cross breeding strains of wheat, the cereals we plant commercially yield a lot more, bigger grains than the grass in your lawn; also has higher amounts of glutens, vitamins etc. Case in point, let a small patch of your lawn grow until you see the seed cluster . Then, next time you're passing a wheat field that is golden yellow and close to harvest, go grab a single stalk. The grains are much later and there are many more of them. A bushel or two of commercial grains, hulled and ground into flower would yeild easily a few cups of flour. You'd probably need your whole yard to seed before you would have enough grains to bake a loaf of bread with.",為什麼不能將普通的草用作穀物？不是每個人（誰住在郊區財產）種植一些食物嗎？,歸結為屈服於好東西 - 穀物。是的，從技術上講，穀物小麥等是穀物，但是在數千年的時間裡，人類已經有選擇地種植和交叉繁殖小麥，我們在商業上種植的穀物比草坪上的草生產更多，更大的穀物。也有更高數量的麩質，維生素等。例子，讓一小塊草坪生長，直到看到種子簇為止。然後，下次您經過金黃色並接近收穫的小麥田時，請抓住一個莖。穀物要晚了，還有更多。一兩個蒲式耳的商業穀物，被剝離並磨成花朵會很容易幾杯麵粉。您可能需要整個院子才能播種，然後再有足夠的穀物烤麵包。
How come we keep adding retail jobs despite the increase of online shopping?,"Many stores cut staff way back during the great recession, well below the natural employment to run their stores, so they are building back up to that level . One of the main ways for retailers to compete with online is by providing service/assistance buyers can't get online, so that takes more sales people. Also, it's just a big sector, that adding a large number of jobs may only be a tiny percentage of growth. There are something like 15 million people working in the retail sector, so adding 150,000 jobs is only 1% growth.",儘管在線購物增加了，我們如何不斷增加零售工作？,"在大蕭條期間，許多商店削減了員工，遠低於自然就業機會，以便經營商店，因此他們正在建立該水平。零售商與網上競爭的主要方法之一是提供服務/援助買家無法上網，因此需要更多的銷售人員。同樣，這只是一個很大的部門，增加大量就業機會可能僅佔增長的一小部分。大約1500萬人在零售業工作，因此增加150,000個工作崗位只有1％的增長。"

"Why do standardized tests, credit scores and other scales not start at zero?","This is something I've always wondered - wouldn't it be easier if every score was out of a round number? e.g LSAT is out of 100, MCAT is out of 100, standardized tests are out of 100, credit score is out of 1000 The only problem that would create for me is that the scores don't seem unique. Knowing the MCAT is 3-45, the ACT is 1-36, the SAT is 600-2400, and the LSA is 120-180 makes each test more unique.

Why can you see more clearly when you squint?,"User ""dracoi"" on [this] thread on Straight Dope explains it quite well: > The fuzziness is because the cornea/lens are supposed to bend light so that a large amount of light is focused on a small area of the retina. When your vision starts to go bad, the focusing is not done as well - light from one edge of your eye is focused on a different place than the light from the other edge of your eye. Some people with bad vision actually see multiple double images or a halo around things because of this. By narrowing the light to a pinhole, the lens and cornea don't have to focus anything - the light passes straight through . Either way, the light's all hitting the same spot like it would if it was being focused correctly. > You're right that less light gets through, but the brain is funny about being able to correct for that. Your brain is more worried about contrast between things than the total light level. This is basically the same effect that makes a [pinhole camera] work.",當您斜視時，為什麼您可以更清楚地看到？,用戶“ dracoi”在直接塗料上的[此]線上很好地解釋了它：>模糊性是因為角膜/鏡頭應該彎曲光，因此大量的光集中在視網膜的一小部分。當您的視力開始變得不好時，焦點就沒有完成 - 眼睛的一個邊緣的光集中在與眼睛另一個邊緣的光線不同的地方。有些視力不好的人實際上看到了多個雙重圖像或周圍的光環。通過將光縮小到針孔，鏡頭和角膜不必集中任何東西 - 光線直通。無論哪種方式，光線都像正確聚焦一樣擊中了相同的位置。>您是對的，較少的光線通過，但是大腦能夠糾正這一點很有趣。您的大腦更擔心事物之間的對比，而不是總光線水平。這基本上是使[針孔攝像頭]起作用的效果。

Why do colleges and university's appear to have so much power when it comes to sexual assault cases?,"There are a lot of misconceptions about this topic and a lot of speculation. Let's start with the facts. > When someone is sexually assaulted in a dorm or on campus, is there anything stopping the victim from going to the police directly and filing a report? There is nothing stopping someone from going right to the police. The campus faculty can do nothing to stop it, and there are no obligation for a student to go to through the college first. If criminal charges are being made the college has nothing to do with it, and colleges cannot even press charges on behalf of the student. They are simply not involved in criminal proceedings at all. So if all this is true, why do you keep hearing the stories you do? First thing to understand is the term 'sexual assault' means *nothing*. Sexual assault can be anything from rape to unwanted flirtation. There is huge girth of activity and severity between those two, and yet it is all frequently combined and reported as sexual assault in news stories and statistics. Many times when a news story says something like: ""Numerous students reported sexual assault from this professor to the college, but the college did nothing about these allegations."" What is actually happening is students came to the college faculty and said ""This professor touches my shoulder during class and I don't like it"" or ""sometimes he says things that I don't appreciate."" It's hard to call the police on an old man that touched a woman's shoulder in class as that is just want plenty of old men do. Therefor this is an issue that is brought to the college staff instead of the police. However, when the professor does something it is truly a crime, the news looks into all reported cases about the professor and they say ""he had three reports of sexual assault and nothing was ever done.""",為什麼在性侵犯案件中，大學和大學似乎擁有如此多的權力？,關於這個主題有很多誤解和很多猜測。讓我們從事實開始。>當某人在宿舍中或在校園內進行性侵犯時，是否有任何阻止受害者直接去警察並提交報告的東西？沒有什麼可以阻止某人直接向警察。校園教師無能為力，沒有義務讓學生首先上大學。如果犯有刑事指控，該大學與它無關，大學甚至無法代表學生提出指控。他們根本沒有參與刑事訴訟。因此，如果所有這些都是真的，為什麼您會繼續聽到自己做的故事呢？首先要理解的是“性侵犯”一詞的意思 *沒有 *。性侵犯可以是從強姦到不必要的調情。這兩個人之間存在著巨大的活動和嚴重性，但在新聞故事和統計數據中，這兩者經常被合併並報告為性侵犯。很多時候，新聞報導說：“許多學生報告了這位教授對大學的性侵犯，但學院對這些指控一無所有。”實際上發生的事情是學生來到大學教師，並說：“這位教授在上課時碰到了我的肩膀，我不喜歡它”或“有時他說的話我不欣賞。”很難打電話給警察一個老人，該老人在課堂上碰到一個女人的肩膀，因為那隻是想要很多老人。因此，這是一個帶給大學工作人員而不是警察的問題。但是，當教授做某事時，這確實是一種犯罪，該消息調查了所有有關教授的報導案件，他們說：“他有三份有關性侵犯的報導，從未做過。”
"Why does lactic acid build up after extended exercise, and almost lock you up to the point where it's hard to walk?","Lactic acid is a byproduct of a chemical reaction that your body uses to generate ATP . Think of ATP as money and that you need to pay each of your organs a certain amount of money to do its job. When you exercise, your body is doing a lot more stuff and therefore needs a lot more money, so you have to start making money faster. This is where lactic acid comes in. The typical way of making money uses the oxygen that we breathe and it yields a LOT more money than the other way, which does not need oxygen but leads to a buildup of lactic acid. You can think of the typical way your body makes money as being a stockbroker, and to make that money the stockbroker needs to breathe oxygen. But when you exercise, the demand for oxygen exceeds its supply , and your organs still need that money to do the work, so you take on a second job at McDonalds that pays a lot less ATP and is also bad for you .When you start working your muscles, the body tries to provide them with enough oxygen to support the activity. In some types of exercise , the body doesn't provide oxygen fast enough and so the muscles use a different mechanism that has lactic acid as a by-product. Lactic acid actually causes the burn you feel during a weight training session that makes successive effort more difficult . The soreness in subsequent days is thought to be an inflammation response as your body repairs damaged muscle tissues, but is not directly caused by lactic acid build up.",乳酸在擴展運動後會積聚，幾乎將您鎖定到難以行走的地步？,乳酸是您身體用於產生ATP的化學反應的副產品。將ATP視為金錢，您需要向每個器官支付一定數量的錢才能完成工作。當您鍛煉時，您的身體正在做更多的事情，因此需要更多的錢，因此您必須開始更快地賺錢。這是乳酸進來的地方。賺錢的典型方法使用我們呼吸的氧氣，它比反過來的氧氣比不需要氧氣的氧氣多得多，而不需要氧氣，而是導致乳酸的積聚。您可以想到身體賺錢的典型方式是作為股票經紀人，並賺取股票經紀人需要呼吸氧氣的錢。但是，當您鍛煉時，對氧氣的需求超過了供應，您的器官仍然需要這筆錢來完成工作，因此您在麥當勞（McDonalds）從事第二份工作，而麥克唐納（McDonalds）的付費少得多，而對您也有害。身體鍛煉肌肉，身體試圖為它們提供足夠的氧氣來支持活動。在某些類型的運動中，人體不夠快地提供氧氣，因此肌肉使用具有乳酸作為副產物的不同機制。乳酸實際上會導致您在體重訓練期間的燃燒，這使得連續的努力變得更加困難。隨後幾天內的酸痛被認為是一種炎症反應，因為您的身體修復受損的肌肉組織，但並非由乳酸堆積直接引起。
"What were the University admissions like in the past, before public examinations?","For the most part, if you had money, you could get in.Look at most if not all famous scientists who from those eras, and you'll see that they were either rich themselves, or had rich families. A big part of this was that science was a hobby at the time, and an expensive one, and so commoners didn't get a chance.I'd also like to say that back then, universities were much less about education, and much more focused on research projects.You didn't really have a choice back then. You either worked the fields all day, went to war, or did other ""Medieval"" sounding jobs. To be ""Accepted"" into a college back then you needed someone to sponsor you, and you needed the gold to back up your attendance and research. College was more about smart people getting together and finding new information back then, nowadays it's getting the slow people up to par with people already workingPublic examinations are much more recent than your question implies -- I think SAT didn't come into vogue as anything valuable for college admissions until the 1930s At least those American universities that we associate with being ""old,"" ie Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, were boys' clubs at the end of the 19th century. WASPs, threatened by increased social mobility that came with the Gilded Age, transformed them into bastions of the ruling class that were not necessarily concerned with how smart the admitted students were. They were admitted based on athleticism and legacies, almost exclusively. Also, basically only students who went to a few feeder boarding schools were even considered. But that's the U.S. And not the 15th century.",在公眾考試之前，大學的錄取是什麼樣的？,在大多數情況下，如果您有錢，您可以進去。從這些時代中最多甚至不是全部著名科學家，您會發現他們要么是富有的，要么有富裕的家庭。其中很大一部分是科學當時是一種愛好，而且是一個昂貴的愛好，因此平民沒有機會。更專注於研究項目。那時您真的沒有選擇。您要么整天從事領域，要么參加戰爭，要么做其他“中世紀”的聲音工作。要被“接受”到大學，然後您需要有人來贊助您，並且需要黃金來支持您的出勤和研究。大學更多地是關於聰明的人聚在一起並在當時找到新信息，如今，慢慢的人與已經工作的人相提並論比您的問題所暗示的要多得多 - 我認為SAT並沒有成為Vogue，因為至少在1930年代，至少我們與“老”（即哈佛，耶魯大學和普林斯頓）聯繫在一起的美國大學是有價值的，這是19世紀末的男孩俱樂部。WASP受到鍍金時代帶來的社會流動性的威脅，將它們轉變為統治階級的堡壘，這些堡壘不一定關注錄取的學生的聰明程度。他們幾乎完全根據運動能力和遺產被錄取。此外，基本上，甚至還考慮了去過幾所餵食器寄宿學校的學生。但這不是美國，而不是15世紀。

How / why does wearing prescription eyeglasses make your vision blurry if you do not require glasses?,"Because eyeglasses are Corrective lenses. Meaning they are there to ""correct"" the image that someone sees because their eyes aren't necessarily working properly. Looking through the glasses with ""normal"" vision you are looking through the correction first. It's like opening your eyes underwater or looking at something through a water bottle. The light coming is is refracted before it comes into your eyes. For someone with a sight problem this is a good thing because it compensates for whatever is wrong with their eyes. For someone who doesn't need them it becomes distorted.It changes the effective focal length of your eyes. Normally the lens of your eye can focus light onto your retina. When glasses are worn by a person with good eyesight the light is refocused at a point that isn't the retina, making the image blurry.",如果您不需要眼鏡，戴處方眼鏡如何 /為什麼會使您的視力模糊？,因為眼鏡是矯正鏡頭。這意味著他們在那裡“糾正”某人看到的圖像，因為他們的眼睛不一定能正常工作。通過“正常”視覺瀏覽眼鏡，您首先要通過校正來查看。這就像在水下睜開眼睛或通過水瓶看一些東西。燈光的光在您眼中折射。對於有視力問題的人來說，這是一件好事，因為它可以彌補他們的眼睛出錯。對於一個不需要它們的人，它會扭曲。它改變了您的眼睛的有效焦距。通常，您的眼睛鏡頭可以將光線聚焦到視網膜上。當眼鏡良好的人戴著眼鏡時，光線會在不是視網膜的點重新聚焦，從而使圖像模糊。

Why is it harder to hold your breath underwater than not underwater?,"I'm not sure what you're basing that on. In fact, humans have the [mammalian diving reflex] which actually allows you to hold your breath longer underwater than on land - if you look at breath-holding records, they're generally done in pools.Its really simple: It isnt. Its actually the other way round. Everything else is just your brain playing tricks on you.",為什麼在水下呼吸比沒有水下更難？,我不確定您是在基於什麼。實際上，人類具有[哺乳動物的潛水反射]，實際上，您可以在水下屏住呼吸比在陸地上保持更長的呼吸 - 如果您查看呼吸記錄，它們通常在游泳池中完成。它真的很簡單：這不是。實際上是相反的。其他一切都只是您的大腦在您身上發揮作用。

Why do so many kids hate math?,"Because it's taught so incredibly badly. Traditional maths teaching involves rote-learning a bunch of algorithms and tables, then doing endless quantities of dogwork practice. The algorithms as taught are entirely opaque, giving no insight into what's going on, no way to sanity-check if the answers are right as you go; it's horrible and bureaucratic - like copying large quantities of numbers from one part of the page to another, only with hard, fiddly transformations along the way that are easy to fuck up, which is discouraging as hell. Most students learn to hate it with a passion; of the few that show aptitude for it, a disturbing percentage can *only* work by rote methods, and have very little insight into solving novel problems or being able to spot errors. It's a bit like teaching kids to read via 'sight words' and never introducing them to the concept of phonics. Most would do very badly at memorising thousands of arbitrary strings of letters - and most of those that managed would be completely stumped by new words, regional dialects, phonetic spellings or the very concept of etymology. This is one of the big things that the common-core maths curriculum seeks to correct. In common-core, less emphasis is put on formal pen-and-paper methods, and more on mental maths strategies, alternate approaches, visualisations, and giving kids a lot more insight into what's going on, how to tackle the problem and *why* it works, rather than just drilling them on what to do. From what I've seen, it could be a real game-changer.",為什麼這麼多孩子討厭數學？,因為它的教導得非常糟糕。傳統的數學教學涉及死記硬背的一堆算法和表格，然後進行無盡的狗工作練習。所教的算法完全不透明，沒有洞察發生的事情，如果答案是正確的，則無法進行理智檢查；這是可怕的和官僚主義的 - 就像將大量數字從頁面的一個部分複製到另一部分一樣，只有在沿途易於操縱的艱難，煩躁的轉換，這是令人沮喪的。大多數學生都學會了以一種熱情討厭它。在表現出符合能力的少數情況下，令人不安的百分比可以通過死記硬背的方法來 *僅起作用，並且對解決新問題或能夠發現錯誤幾乎沒有洞察力。這有點像教孩子們通過“視覺單詞”閱讀，而從未將他們介紹給語音概念。大多數人在記住數千個任意字母的字符串方面的表現非常糟糕 - 大多數管理的字母都會被新單詞，區域方言，語音拼寫或詞源的概念完全困擾。這是普通核心數學課程尋求糾正的重要事情之一。在普通核心中，更少的重點是正式的筆和紙方法，以及更多的精神數學策略，替代方法，可視化，並使孩子更深入地了解正在發生的事情，如何解決問題以及 *為什麼*它有效，而不僅僅是在做什麼。據我所知，這可能是一個真正的遊戲規則改變者。
Why is our urine the color it is?,"There's no direct route from your mouth to your bladder. What you pee, gets broken down in your digestive tract, goes through your bloodstream, gets processed in your kidneys, and into your bladder. Not a lot of pigments from stuff you've ingested survives the trip. A few pigments out there are able to color your urine, but it's pretty uncommon. Now, your body makes a ton of blood cells, and it goes through a lot all the time. They do their job, they die, they get broken down. The biproducts of that breakdown are typically what color both your [urine], and your [poop]. They're responsible for the yellow and the brown both. So what you are seeing is largely colored by broken down blood cells. As far as the dark yellow to clear range, this is mostly hydration. The more hydrated you are, the greater proportion of water to waste material. So it is more diluted and the color is less apparent.",為什麼我們的尿液是顏色？,從您的嘴到膀胱沒有直接路線。尿尿，在消化道中被分解，穿過血液，在腎臟中加工並進入膀胱。您攝入的東西中沒有很多顏料倖存下來。那裡有幾種顏料可以使您的尿液上色，但這並不常見。現在，您的身體會產生大量的血細胞，並且一直在經歷很多。他們完成工作，死了，被分解了。該崩潰的兩種分子通常是您的[尿液]和[糞便]的顏色。他們負責黃色和棕色。因此，您所看到的很大程度上是由於細胞細胞而染色的。至於深黃色到透明範圍，這主要是水合。您的水分越多，水比浪費物質的比例越多。因此，顏色更加稀釋，顏色也不明顯。
how is cheeto cheese made?,"Pretty much any cheese can be turned into powder, if you dry the cheese either with an oven or a dehydrator it becomes very easy to crumple into powder, then you can just mix it with whey powder and whisk it until it all becomes a fine flour-like powder. Once it's powder, you can easily apply it to a number of food items, such as puffed cornmeal, thus making a cheesy snack. I can't say exactly what process they use to make their powder or what other additives they have, but it's likely Cheetos is mostly just cornmeal and powdered cheese, you could probably make them homemade pretty similar.",Cheeto奶酪是如何製成的？,幾乎所有奶酪都可以變成粉末，如果用烤箱或脫水器將奶酪乾燥，它變得很容易變成粉末，然後您只需將其與乳清粉混合併攪拌均勻，直到它變成優質的麵粉 - 像粉末。一旦粉末，您就可以輕鬆地將其應用於許多食品，例如蓬鬆的玉米麵，從而製作俗氣的小吃。我不能確切說出他們用來製作粉末或其他添加劑的過程，但是Cheetos可能主要只是玉米麵和粉狀奶酪，您可能會讓它們自製非常相似。

"If we removed a chunk of the sun (say like 1/4), what would happen?","Gravity would force the sun into a sphere again. In the long run the sun would continue to shine, but less brightly and it would have a longer life. In the short run the energy released by the sun collapsing back into a sphere would almost certainly kill everything on EarthYes, no, and yes. The sun isn't solid, so it would become spherical again under gravity. It's always exploding, and the size of the sun to begin with is a balance between gravity wanting to compress it down, and the constant ""explosion"" wanting to push it out. It 'd be unstable for a while but I imagine it would find equilibrium again .

Can anyone explain what is going on with Northwestern U unionizing?,"This is a very long topic, but I'll try to be brief. Basically, the players want to unionize because they want to get more rights and better benefits. They see that collegiate athletics is become more and more profitable and the university's are raking in tons of cash- but the players are not seeing a corresponding increase in their benefits, i.e. a higher stipend, more tuition assitance, better housing, etc. By unionizing, they now have a voice in negotiating better perks for players. Also bear in mind: these players, like pro football players, have a very short shelf life. With average pro careers lasting 3.5 years, football players have an especially acute interest in having a say in their working conditions .From the school's standpoint, they want to have full control over the types of benefits they provide to players. Like any employer, they have more flexibility, control and profit if players are put in a ""take it or leave it"" position. They also claim that this blurs the line between student and worker, but this is just rhetoric since university's regularly employ students for a variety of tasks- and there are many unions for such students . The NCAA has similar interests as the school, so I'll dispense with them. If you want to dig deeper into this, one of my professors is widely considered the foremost expert on collegiate athlete unionization, here is an article he wrote on this: _URL_0_",誰能解釋西北U工會的情況？,這是一個很長的話題，但我會嘗試簡短。基本上，玩家想結合，因為他們希望獲得更多的權利和更好的利益。他們看到大學田徑運動變得越來越有利可圖，大學的貨幣量越來越大 - 但是球員們沒有看到相應的福利增加，即，通過結合結合，他們的津貼，更高的學費，更好的住房，更好的住房等。，他們現在有一個聲音，可以為玩家談判更好的好處。還要記住：這些球員，像職業足球運動員一樣，保質期很短。由於平均職業生涯持續了3。5年，因此足球運動員對在工作條件下發表自己的發言特別興趣。從學校的角度來看，他們希望完全控制給球員提供的福利類型。像任何雇主一樣，如果將玩家置於“接受或離開它”職位的情況下，他們就具有更大的靈活性，控制和利潤。他們還聲稱這模糊了學生和工人之間的界限，但這只是言論，因為大學經常僱用學生完成各種任務，並且有許多工會適合這樣的學生。NCAA的興趣與學校相似，因此我將與他們分配。如果您想更深入地研究這一點，我的一位教授被廣泛認為是大學運動員工會的最重要專家，這是他在此上寫的一篇文章：_url_0_
Why didn't NATO disband after the fall of the Soviet Union?,"Just because they changed up the names of their political parties makes them no less of a threat. NATO was formed to stop the incursion of communism into Europe and other countries. You also have to realize even though NATO has now changed directions from an originally anti communism organization/common protection force, there are still serious threats that makes them all want to work together to provide for a common defense. Another thing that you must realize is this: Even though the ""USSR"" has fallen, most of the old leadership is still in place, and might just change titles every few years . Ninja Edit: To further expand on it, realize that the old leadership of the USSR/1980's Russia is still around, so they will naturally see them as a threat to their expansionist attitude.NATO's expansion from ~1991 to the Georgian war was more so about joining an elite club than a security pact against Russia. For former Eastern Block countries, joining NATO was often seen as a pre-requisite to joining other Western organizations, such as the European Union. Certain military and organizational standards . had to be met to join NATO, so the accomplishment of joining NATO was often seen as a sign of the country being ready to join other international organizations with more complicated admitting requirements. All that said, *NATO's mission* never changed; instead, NATO was used to as a stepping stone into the Western world. It is quite easy to see how Russia would be upset at previous Warsaw Pact countries joining NATO. Even if NATO had no intention to attack Russia, NATO membership by Eastern European countries still represented the decline of Russian influence and power in Eastern Europe. **Edit**: Clarified Warsaw Pact, not Warsaw the city",北約為什麼在蘇聯倒台後解散？,僅僅因為他們改變了政黨的名字，就會使他們受到威脅。北約的成立是為了阻止共產主義入侵歐洲和其他國家。即使北約現在已經從最初的反共產主義組織/共同保護部隊改變了方向，您也必須意識到，仍然存在嚴重的威脅，使他們都希望共同努力以提供共同的辯護。您必須意識到的另一件事是：即使“蘇聯”已經下降，大多數舊領導仍然存在，並且可能每隔幾年就會改變頭銜。忍者編輯：為了進一步擴展它，意識到蘇聯/1980年代俄羅斯的舊領導仍然存在，因此他們自然會將它們視為對擴張主義態度的威脅。Nato從1991年向喬治亞戰爭的擴展更加如此關於加入精英俱樂部比針對俄羅斯的安全協議。對於前東部街區國家，加入北約通常被視為加入其他西方組織（例如歐盟）的先決條件。某些軍事和組織標準。必須開會加入北約，因此，加入北約的成就通常被視為該國準備加入其他國際組織，並具有更為複雜的承認要求。話雖如此， *北約的使命 *從未改變；取而代之的是，北約習慣了進入西方世界的墊腳石。很容易看出在以前的華沙公約國家加入北約，俄羅斯將如何感到沮喪。即使北約無意攻擊俄羅斯，東歐國家的北約成員仍然代表了東歐俄羅斯影響力和權力的下降。**編輯**：澄清華沙條約，而不是華沙城市
"what's the difference between a sautee pan and a frying pan, and does it justify the frying pan being 50-150% higher in price?","A saute pan has a wide, flat bottom and more straight vertical sides. In contrast a frying pan has more rounded sides and therefore a smaller flat bottom. Due to this a saute pan typically is heavier than an equally sized frying pan as it contains more material, requiring a suitably sturdier handle as well. If this justifies the kind of price increases you imply is subjective but I would say it does not. Generally speaking you can use a frying pan to do anything you would with a saute pan if needed.",炒鍋和煎鍋有什麼區別，這是否證明煎鍋的價格高出50-150％？,炒鍋的底部寬，平坦，垂直方向更直。相比之下，煎鍋的側面更圓，因此平坦的底部較小。因此，炒鍋通常比同等大小的煎鍋重，因為它包含更多的材料，還需要更堅固的手柄。如果這證明了您所暗示的價格上漲的合理性是主觀的，但我會說不是。一般而言，如果需要，您可以使用煎鍋用炒鍋來做任何您會做的任何事情。
Why is some pain sharp? Why is some like a dull ache?,"Different areas of the body respond differently to pain.

Why do some places require my debit card pin while others don't?,"You're card can be processed as either a debit or credit card. A debit transaction requires the pin while credit does not.

If you don't want to use your pin at the gas station just tell the cashier to do it as credit. McDonalds probably doesn't care about the charge and is more interested in speed of transaction.",為什麼有些地方需要我的借記卡銷，而另一些地方則不需要？,您的卡可以作為藉記卡或信用卡處理。借方交易需要PIN，而信用不需要。該銀行收取借方和信貸的不同費率。該商店希望您使用借方，因為它的成本較小，銀行希望您使用信用，因為它們可以為交易收取更多費用。如果您不想在加油站使用PIN，只需告訴收銀員作為信用。麥當勞可能不在乎這項費用，對交易速度更感興趣。

Why does an orgasm clear the sinuses?,"An orgasm triggers the release of adrenaline in the body. Releasing adrenaline helps shrink the mucus membranes, making it easier to breath.

"How do starfish regenerate lost limbs? Why aren't more advanced species able to do this, slash wouldn't it be an advantage for species to have retained this ability while evolving?","The process of regenerating new limbs is very complex and only partly understood. Basically, regeneration is the ability of an animal's cells to make new body parts during adulthood, just like they did during embryonic development.During embryonic development, most of an animal's cells take on a particular identity--they become blood cells, lung cells, bone cells, or whatever. This is called differentiation, and differentiated cells almost always keep their new identities forever. A special type of cell called a stem cell sometimes remains behind without a particular identity. Stem cells can be thought of as ""permanently immature"" cells that can decide later what fate to take on. Starfish and some other animals have cells like this that can do more than just make new skin, they can differentiate into whole new arms. In order for them to do this, they need to receive the right signals from the rest of the body. If we lose a limb, we either don't send the right signals to our stem cells, or our stem cells are not able to differentiate into all the parts necessary for a whole new limb. Starfish seem to send the right signals, and their cells are able to differentiate properly, so they are able to regenerate whole new limbs. We don't know yet exactly what those signals are, or why some stem cells are able to differentiate more than others. Scientists think that this may be easier for them, because their bodies are not as complex as ours.",海星如何再生四肢損失？為什麼更先進的物種能夠做到這一點，斜線在不斷發展的過程中保留這種能力不是一個優勢嗎？,再生新四肢的過程非常複雜，只有部分理解。基本上，再生是動物細胞在成年期間變成新身體部位的能力，就像它們在胚胎髮育過程中一樣。起來胚胎髮育，動物的大多數細胞都具有特定的身份 - 它們成為血細胞，肺細胞，肺細胞，肺細胞，骨細胞或其他。這稱為差異化，分化的細胞幾乎總是永遠保持其新身份。一種稱為乾細胞的特殊類型的細胞有時會留在沒有特定身份的情況下。可以將乾細胞視為“永久性不成熟”細胞，可以決定以後要承擔什麼命運。海星和其他一些動物具有這樣的細胞，不僅可以使新皮膚變成新的皮膚，還可以分為全新的手臂。為了使他們這樣做，他們需要從身體其餘部分接收正確的信號。如果我們失去肢體，我們要么不會向幹細胞發送正確的信號，要么我們的干細胞無法區分全新肢體所需的所有部分。海星似乎發送正確的信號，並且它們的細胞能夠正確區分，因此它們能夠再生全新的四肢。我們還不知道這些信號是什麼，或者為什麼某些幹細胞能夠比其他信號更區分。科學家認為這對他們來說可能更容易，因為他們的身體不像我們那樣複雜。

"How/Why did Pasadena, CA become such a wealthy area?","not sure it's that wealthy - the median income is only $62k per year, about 1/3 of the wealthiest areas of bel air, hidden hills, and palos verdes. of course the wealthiest areas will tend to be by the beaches, but since LA is big and congested it made sense from a development perspective for wealthy people in the 1930s to build neighborhoods on the other side of downtown since the beach area was already taken. this really took off when people began coming to SoCal for vacations after WW1. pasadena was growing due to industry and the hotels being built happened to cater to wealthy people. fast forward 70 years and here we are. if you look at development patterns many metro areas have a really wealthy area and secondary wealth centers beyond that. NY has long island and the northern suburbs, Chicago has the loop and the northern suburbs, SF has and silicon valley.",加利福尼亞州帕薩迪納（Pasadena）如何/為什麼成為一個如此富裕的地區？,不確定這是富人 - 中位收入每年僅為$ 62K，大約是Bel Air，Hidden Hills和Palos Verdes的最富有地區的1/3。當然，最富有的地區往往是在海灘上，但是由於洛杉磯很大並且很擁擠，從發展的角度來看，1930年代富人在海灘地區已經採取了海灘區域以來，在1930年代的富人在市區另一端建造社區。當人們在第二次世界大戰後開始去SoCal度假時，這確實起步了。帕薩迪納（Pasadena）由於工業而發展，建造的酒店恰好適合富人。快進了70年，我們在這裡。如果您查看發展模式，許多都會區擁有一個非常富裕的地區，而次要財富的中心超越了此。紐約州有長島和北部郊區，芝加哥有環路和北部郊區，SF和矽谷。
"Reddit's apparent stance that all GMO food is just fine. If it's all good for us, then why the public outcry against it?","Because the outcry is primarily driven by fear of things you don't understand but that can be made to sound scary. It's the radiation of the 21st century. The people pushing hard on this, and hitting the soft amphibian spot in your brain that bypasses rational thought are also, not coincidentally, selling something. Couple of things:1) Don't confuse loud noises with actual public outcry. A few screamers is not the same as the general public being very upset.2) Even if the general public was in an uproar, you should remember this paraphrased quote from George Carlin:""Think how stupid the average American is, and then remember, half of them are stupider than that""3) Finally, what *is* GMO? At what point does controlled reproduction of crops turn from selective breeding to ""genetic modification""?', ""A loud outcry doesn't make something more or less true any more than an obscure book must be bad.",雷迪特（Reddit）明顯地說，所有轉基因食品都很好。如果這對我們有好處，那麼為什麼公眾對此表示反對呢？,因為強烈的抗議主要是由於對您不了解的事情的恐懼所驅動，但聽起來很恐怖。這是21世紀的輻射。人們對此進行努力，並擊中大腦中柔和的兩棲動物，繞過理性思想的人也不是偶然地賣出東西。幾件事：1）不要將大聲的聲音與實際的公眾強烈抗議混淆。幾個尖叫者與公眾非常沮喪。2）即使普通大眾在騷亂中，您也應該記住喬治·卡林（George Carlin）的這句話：“想想普通美國人有多愚蠢，然後記住，記住，記住，記得其中一半比“ 3）最後， * * GMO是什麼？在什麼時候控制的農作物從選擇性繁殖轉變為“遺傳修飾”？'，“大聲的抗議都不會使事情變得更加或更少，而不是一本晦澀的書一定是不好的。
How does the birthday problem (Birthday Paradox) work?,"The thing that makes the birthday paradox paradoxical, is that people look at the number of individuals and compare that to 365 and say ""that can't be right"". But it's not ""what are the odds that one of these people have a certain birthday"" it's ""what are the odds that two of these people share a birthday"". The difference is that you need to compare the number of pairs of people, not the number of people. And the pairs of people increases exponentially with the number of people.Those would be the odds of finding *one* specific birthday. For example, if I wanted to find a December 21st baby in a room full of 70 people, I'd have a 70/365 chance to find one. But the question is asking if *any* two of the people in the room share a birthday - meaning that in this situation there are up to 70 possible dates to match. And as the number of people in the room increases, the number of possible matches increases as well, so it quickly becomes a very likely possibility.",生日問題（生日悖論）如何工作？,使生日悖論悖論的原因是，人們看著個人的數量，並將其與365進行比較，並說“那是不對的”。但這不是“其中一個人有一定生日的可能性是什麼”，而是“其中兩個人共享生日的機率”。不同之處在於，您需要比較人數的數量，而不是人數。成對的人與人數成倍增加。例如，如果我想在一個充滿70人的房間裡找到一個12月21日的嬰兒，我將有70/365的機會找到一個。但是，問題是問 *房間中的兩個人是否有一個生日 - 這意味著在這種情況下，有多達70個可能的日期可以匹配。隨著房間中的人數的增加，可能的匹配數量也增加了，因此很快就會成為可能性。
How do pupils contract and grow?,"The pupil is the space where the light goes inside your eye to your retina, to form the image that gets processed in your brain. So, just like a TV, you have to set the right level of brightness to get a clear image. Too much light or not enough light and details are too fuzzy, besides that too much light hurts like hell. Around the pupils you have the iris which is the colored region of the eye. This region controls the levels of light that go through the pupil, by regulating the size of it. In order to this to happen you need two kinds of muscles: - The circular ones, that contract on the presence of light and close down the pupil, reducing the amount of the light that goes in; - Straight ones that go from the pupil to the outer edge of the eye. These contract on the absence of light increasing the amount of light that goes in. The size of pupils may also change because of drugs and levels of stress and anxiety. Of course this is the mechanism on animals. On cars it might be a similar thing if anything on Cars and Cars 2 is true.",學生如何收縮和成長？,瞳孔是光線內眼內到視網膜的空間，形成在大腦中處理的圖像。因此，就像電視一樣，您必須設置正確的亮度才能獲得清晰的圖像。光線過多或沒有足夠的光線，細節太模糊了，除了太多的光線會像地獄一樣受傷。在瞳孔周圍，您的虹膜是眼睛的彩色區域。該區域通過調節其大小來控制通過瞳孔的光水平。為此，您需要兩種肌肉： - 圓形的肌肉，它們在光線上的簽約並關閉瞳孔，從而減少了進入的光的量； - 從瞳孔到眼睛外邊緣的直線。這些在沒有光線的情況下會增加攝入的光量。學生的大小也可能因藥物以及壓力和焦慮水平而改變。當然，這是動物的機制。在汽車上，如果汽車和汽車2上的任何東西都是正確的，那可能是類似的事情。
What types of muscle memory deteriorate fastest? Why is learning to ride a bike again so much easier than re-learning other things?,"Because procedural memories are literally embedded deeper and more strongly into our brains. Consider that your brain is a physical thing, and how it organizes and taps into memories stored in physical locations matters. How hard is it to find a file on your computer when you hide through a million obscure folders versus when it's sitting on your desktop? Scientists believe that procedural memory is probably stored more deeply and strongly or at least differently than other kinds of memory because alzheimer's patients often remember how to do things even if they can't consciously remember knowing how to do it. People with different types of brain injuries that damage their ability to form new memories also still form procedural memories, like learning to draw a rose. They just don't know that they've learned how to do it, but when you ask them to try, they keep improving every time.",哪種類型的肌肉記憶最快惡化？為什麼要學會再次騎自行車比重新學習其他事物容易得多？,因為程序記憶實際上更深，更強烈地嵌入了我們的大腦中。認為您的大腦是物理上的事情，以及它如何組織和挖掘在物理位置中存儲的記憶很重要。當您通過一百萬個模糊的文件夾而不是坐在台式機上時，在計算機上找到文件有多困難？科學家認為，程序記憶可能與其他類型的記憶更深入，更強烈或至少有所不同，因為阿爾茨海默氏症的患者也經常記得如何做事，即使他們不能有意識地記得知道該怎麼做。具有不同類型的腦損傷的人會損害其形成新記憶的能力，這也仍然形成程序記憶，例如學習畫玫瑰。他們只是不知道自己已經學會瞭如何做，但是當您要求他們嘗試時，他們每次都會不斷進步。

The actual process of sexual selection is rather more complex, however, and intelligence is only one factor in it. In part, sexual selection should be based on other markers of fitness as well .

How are horses so strong/powerful/fast when their legs are so thin?,"Tendons. The legs need to be as light as possible so they can accelerate/decelerate quickly.

How have sloths survived in a world where natural selection demands the opposite of how they behave?,They blend in well and don't move fast enough to attract the eye of many predators. Living up in trees also eliminates many ground predators.,在自然選擇需要與其行為相反的世界中，懶惰如何倖存？,它們融合得很好，動作不夠快，無法吸引許多捕食者的眼睛。住在樹木中也消除了許多地面掠食者。
Why dont countries battle to expand borders anymore?,"They do. They are. [Here] is an article is today's Washington Post about the ongoing bloody war in South Sudan about territorial disputes with Sudan. Over the past few weeks, there has been talk of possible armed conflict between China and Japan because of a dispute over the ownership of land ). There are lots of little conflicts going on all the time about little changes between the boundaries between countries. It's much rarer to have big conflicts over big changes to boundaries. Big wars don't happen often, and they didn't happen often in the past.",國家為什麼不再為擴大邊界而戰？,他們是這樣。他們是。[這裡]是今天的《華盛頓郵報》，講述了南蘇丹正在進行的關於與蘇丹領土爭端的流血戰爭。在過去的幾周中，由於對土地所有權的爭議，中國和日本之間可能的武裝衝突一直存在。關於國家之間邊界之間幾乎沒有變化的幾乎沒有變化的衝突，發生了很多衝突。對邊界的重大變化產生重大衝突是稀有的。大戰並不經常發生，過去並不經常發生。
What makes a feature film look different than regular video recording?,"Higher quality cameras, different ratios, but mainly color correcting. Color correcting adds the overall theatric and cinematic feel o a film. It's why when you see raw footage of the movie it looks like a lower quality. There is sometimes some cg overlay as well.",是什麼使故事片看起來與常規視頻錄製不同？,更高質量的相機，不同的比率，但主要是校正顏色。顏色校正增加了電影的整體戲劇和電影感覺。這就是為什麼當您看到電影的原始鏡頭時，它看起來像是質量較低的原因。有時也有一些CG覆蓋層。
Why do people get angry at someone being arrogant?,"The very nature of being arrogant is the belief that you are better, even the best, whether justified or not. When you are arrogant around people, you are basically telling them that you are better than them. No one likes to be put down, talked down to, or made to feel inadequate. Note: Please be aware there is a difference between being arrogant and having self-confidence.",人們為什麼會對某人自大生氣？,傲慢自大的本質是，您的信念是，無論是否有道理，您都會更好，甚至最好。當您在人們周圍傲慢自大時，您基本上是在告訴他們您比他們更好。沒有人喜歡被放下，談論或使人感到不足。注意：請注意，自大和自信之間是有區別的。
Why do we have to break glass to access fire extinguishers?,"* it is a safety glass or weak plastic, and not terribly dangerous* it discourages frivolous use* it makes it clear when it has been used, so it can be inspected and recharged as necessary', ""I think that's an old convention.

What is sunburn and how does it heal?,"A sunburn is where the UV rays have essentially cooked the top layers of skin. They heal by opening the blood vessels which send anti-body rich blood to the skin in an attempt to heal it. In cases where it is extremely severe they may use other methods to help the healing. One of the oldest methods that is tried and true is maggots. They apply maggots to the burned areas, and they eat away at only the dead flesh, after which they are removed and the new, fresh, living skin is allowed to heal properly.",什麼是曬傷，如何治愈？,曬傷是紫外線基本上煮熟皮膚頂層的地方。他們通過打開血管來治愈，這些血管將抗體豐富的血液傳遞給皮膚，以試圖治愈它。在極度嚴重的情況下，他們可能會使用其他方法來幫助康復。嘗試和真實的最古老的方法之一是maggots。他們在被燒毀的區域施加雜物，只在死肉中吃掉，然後將其去除，新鮮的，新鮮的生命皮膚可以正確癒合。
Could anyone simply explain the advantages and disadvantages of the gold standard system over our current economic model?,"Advantages: * Some people seem to feel more comfortable with a gold standard Disadvantages: * If there's too much gold around, uncontrollable inflation happens* If there's too little gold around, uncontrollable deflation happens* The government has no way to manage the money supply to help the economy",誰能簡單地解釋黃金標準系統比我們當前的經濟模型的優勢和缺點？,優點： *有些人似乎對黃金標準的缺點感到更加自在： *如果周圍有太多黃金，發生不可控制的通貨膨脹 *幫助經濟
"If we acknowledge some breeds of dogs have different temperaments and intelligence levels, why is it wrong to assume the same for humans?","We as humans are really, phenomenally bad at being accurate with this sort of thing. Not only are we prone to stereotyping a group based on differences which are far smaller than the stereotypes or even don't exist , but we also don't have a great way of telling the difference between the effects of nature and the effects of nurture. If I place a dozen orange people in a mansion and a dozen purple people in a shack, I'd be correct to assert that the orange people are doing much better off. I could even pull out statistics showing that I was totally correct in exactly how much better off they were. But even if for some reason orange genes are, on average, better in some way than purple genes, their environments are massive confounders of the data. So it's not that humans don't have the potential for different, race-based traits. They do. But the actual degree to which they exist is so fuzzy - and the consequences of believing the wrong thing are so serious - that at this point, it's wiser to focus on other differences.",如果我們承認某些狗的氣質和智力水平不同，為什麼對人類也是如此？,作為人類，我們真的很糟糕，無法對這種事情進行準確。我們不僅可以根據差異遠小於刻板印象，甚至不存在，而且我們也沒有很好的方式來辨別自然效應與養育效果之間的差異。如果我將十幾個人在豪宅中放置在棚屋裡，十幾個人在棚屋裡，我會正確地斷言橙色人的狀況要好得多。我什至可以拿出統計數據，表明我完全正確的情況是完全正確的。但是，即使出於某種原因，橙色基因平均比紫色基因更好，它們的環境也是數據的巨大混雜因素。因此，這並不是人類沒有具有不同種族基於種族的特徵的潛力。他們是這樣。但是它們存在的實際程度是如此模糊 - 相信錯誤的事情是如此嚴重的後果 - 在這一點上，專注於其他差異是明智的。
"Why can I fall asleep in noisy environments (school lectures, public transport, cinemas, etc) but an even lesser amount of noise can disturb my sleep when I'm in bed?","Much of our perception is focused on revealing differences. Thus it is not the level of the noise but the uniformity of it. Say for example you fixed tacos for dinner. You notice the yummy smell of food as its cooking, you enjoy the aroma as you take your first bit. Then after dinner you clean up, watch a tv show and relax. Before you head upstairs to go to bed you take the trash out. You notice the air smells brisk and clean. You walk back in and the smell of mexican food nearly knocks you over. You didn't notice this before you took the trash out because it became the new normal. You mind adjusted to the mexican food smell and it became the new baseline odor. Sounds even vision are the same way. Right now your brain is rendering invisible tiny blood vessels in your eye because they don't move. You mind erases them assuming you don't care about them, allowing you to focus your attention on the things that change. Think about how noise canceling head phones work. They create a wave form opposite of the wave form entering your ear and play that back to cancel out the outside sound. Essentially they are making sounds to fill in the differences of the outside sound. You still have the same sound pressure level reaching your ear, but because its constant and causes no vibration you hear nothing .",為什麼我可以在嘈雜的環境（學校講座，公共交通，電影院等）中入睡，但是當我在床上床上時，噪音的噪音更少會打擾我的睡眠？,我們的大部分觀念都集中在揭示差異上。因此，它不是噪聲的水平，而是噪聲的均勻性。例如，您將炸玉米餅固定在晚餐中。您會注意到食物的美味味道在烹飪時味道，您可以在第一一點時享受香氣。然後晚餐後，您清理工作，觀看電視節目並放鬆。在樓上上床睡覺之前，您將垃圾拿出來。您會注意到空氣聞起來很輕鬆。您回去，墨西哥食物的氣味幾乎使您震驚。在將垃圾取出之前，您沒有註意到這一點，因為它已成為新的常態。您介意適應墨西哥的食物氣味，並成為新的基線氣味。聽起來甚至視覺是一樣的。現在，您的大腦正在使您的眼睛看不見的小血管，因為它們不會移動。您介意擦除它們，假設您不在乎它們，從而使您可以將注意力集中在變化的事情上。考慮一下降噪的頭部手機如何工作。它們創建了一個波形與波形相反的波形，進入您的耳朵，然後播放它以取消外部聲音。從本質上講，他們正在發出聲音以填補外部聲音的差異。您仍然具有相同的聲音水平到達耳朵，但是由於它的恆定並且不會引起振動，所以您什麼也沒聽到。
the pros and cons of GMOs,"Pro GMO foods: Crop yields can be improved by as much as 10x, allowing more people to be fed. Crop diseases can be wiped out, improving yields further.

Is time travel possible??,"Sure. You are going forward in the future all the time. We also know exactly what to do for you to experience a second while the whole world ages through centuries. Basically the faster you move, the slower your time goes, so at certain speeds, your second will be a year for the rest of the world. Same thing happens with gravity - the more gravity the slower times goes, so clocks on the Moon go faster than clocks on Earth. You could theoretically get an orbit around a black hole, so that your time slows down enough, that when you return you'll find yourself in a far future. Both of these things are proven experimentally and most famous example are GPS satellites which were highly inaccurate before these effects were accounted for. --- Backwards time travel works too, but only in equatioms. Theoretivally if you were going faster than light it would work. The only problem is that going at the speed of light is impossible. If you were to find a wormhole , they could transport you in time as well.",時間旅行是否可能？,當然。將來您將一直前進。我們也確切地知道如何為您體驗一秒鐘，而整個世界都經歷了幾個世紀。基本上，您移動的速度越快，時間越慢，因此以某些速度，您的第二個將是世界其他地方的一年。重力發生同樣的事情 - 重力越慢，因此月球上的時鐘速度比地球上的時鐘快。從理論上講，您可以在黑洞周圍獲得軌道，以便您的時間減慢足夠的速度，以至於當您返回時，您會在很遠的未來中找到自己。這兩種東西都是經過實驗證明的，最著名的例子是GPS衛星，在考慮這些影響之前，這些衛星高度不准確。---向後的時間旅行也有效，但僅在Equatioms中。從理論上講，如果您的行駛速度比光快，它將起作用。唯一的問題是，以光速行駛是不可能的。如果您要找到一個蟲洞，他們也可以及時運送您。

Why we can't transplant intestines,"We can transplant intestines. However, ulcerative colitis is poor candidate because it is thought to be mostly caused by your own immune system attacking your intestines. They will probably attack someone else's intestines just as badly, so the disease will just reoccur. When you get a transplant, you usually have to be on powerful immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of your life to prevent rejection of the organ. But, immunosuppressives are also a treatment for ulcerative colitis itself. If the immunosuppressives were effective for you and the dangers of them seemed warranted, you would just take them in the first place and skip the transplant. If they don't work for you, then the transplant probably won't either.",為什麼我們不能移植腸,我們可以移植腸道。但是，潰瘍性結腸炎是候選較差的候選者，因為它主要是由您自己的免疫系統攻擊腸道引起的。他們可能會嚴重攻擊別人的腸道，因此該疾病只會再次發生。當您進行移植時，通常必須在餘生中使用強大的免疫抑製藥物，以防止拒絕器官。但是，免疫抑製劑也是潰瘍性結腸炎本身的治療方法。如果免疫抑製劑對您有效，並且似乎有必要的危險，那麼您首先將其拿走並跳過移植。如果他們不適合您，那麼移植可能也不會。

Now, unless you value an apple at double or more that of a banana then it is only rational that you take the bananas.",什麼是理性選擇理論？,用ELI5術語，RCT假設一個人將權衡行動的成本和收益，如果福利超過成本，則採取行動進行行動。最重要的是，它還假設一個人總是需要更多而不是更少的東西。例如，我為您提供兩個香蕉或一個蘋果。現在，除非您重視蘋果的兩倍或更高的香蕉，否則您將其占用香蕉才是理性的。

Does the 30 seconds in a microwave make any difference?,"That 'w' stands for ""watts"". It's a measure of how much power the microwave puts out. And power * time = energy. 750w * 4mins = 180 kJ of energy 850w * 3min 30 secs = 178 kJ So that change in 30 seconds is to allow microwaves with different power outputs to transfer the same amount of enery to the food""w"" is watts. It's a measure of power output. A 750w microwave does not put out as much power as a 850w microwave, or a 1100w microwave , so the food doesn't heat up as fast, so you need to cook it for more timeWatt is power output, in joule per second. 750W * 240 s = 180 000 Joule 850W * 210 s = 178 500 Joule See, by giving more power over a shorter amount of time you get about the same effect.I am not sure what you're asking.

",有什麼變化，使男人不再戴帽子（和西服）？,我不知道帽子，但是您看到了西裝的價格嗎？我可以舒適地吃兩週的價格，價格還可以。不是一個好人，一個還可以的人。隨著人們每天開始洗澡，山頂變得不那麼普遍。由於人們在各地乘坐私家車，人們開始在戶外花費更少的時間。西裝最初是一種表明您是那個小精英的成員的一種方式：在辦公桌工作中工作的人，或者至少一份與手動勞動或骯髒或汗水無關的工作。一旦這變得普遍 - 富裕國家的經濟體從主要是農業和手動勞動轉變為主要服務和信息工作 - 實用性克服了看起來“特殊”的願望，因為這不再是特殊的主要原因，人們停止戴上帽子的原因是汽車。您是否曾經嘗試過戴著頭頂上戴頂帽的汽車？帽子主要是有用的。它們被用來防止陽光/雨水和塵埃來保護 - 肯尼迪不戴帽子在競選活動中，這普遍可以接受。西裝仍然很普遍，但是隨著50年代的青年文化開始下降，90年代的“商業休閒”趨勢起飛，我們看到更多休閒服裝的出現是我們的標準。另外，整天穿著牛仔褲和T穿著牛仔褲和T。

Why does looking at somebody else's wounds or injuries cause me to feel disgusted/uncomfortable?,"Part of it is that people are gross, but most of it from a psychological perspective has to do with empathy and sympathy. We don't want ourselves to get hurt, and that manifests as physical discomfort when we see others hurt, sometimes to the point of screaming, crying, vomiting, or fainting. Besides that, a useful reference for feelings of disgust is the movie “Inside Out,” where it's explained that disgust keeps the body safe, like when Riley won't eat broccoli. She's disgusted and repelled because it smells bad, and the body wants to be as sure as possible that bad smells aren't harmful.Oh I just learned this! Our brains have this type of neuron called ""mirror neurons"". Mirror neurons have a lot of activity when two things happen: 1) when you do something and 2) when you see someone do the same thing. So when you see someone hit their head, your mirror neurons fire and you get reminded of you hitting your head. edit: this might not answer the disgusted part of the question but might help with the uncomfortable part",為什麼看別人的傷口或傷害會使我感到噁心/不舒服？,其中的一部分是人們很粗糙，但是從心理角度來看，大多數人與同情和同情有關。我們不希望自己受到傷害，當我們看到別人受傷時，這表現為身體上的不適，有時甚至是尖叫，哭泣，嘔吐或暈厥。除此之外，電影“ Inside Out”是一個有用的參考，其中解釋說，厭惡使身體安全，就像Riley不會吃西蘭花一樣。她的厭惡和排斥是因為聞起來很臭，並且身體希望盡可能確保不良氣味並不有害。哦，我剛剛學會了這一點！我們的大腦有這種稱為“鏡像神經元”的神經元。當兩件事發生時，鏡像神經元會有很多活動：1）當您做某事和2）看到某人做同樣的事情時。因此，當您看到有人撞到他們的頭時，您的鏡子神經元會發射，您會想起自己的頭。編輯：這可能無法回答問題的厭惡部分，但可能有助於解決不舒服的部分
Why does 70° on my thermostat feel different than 70° outside?,"Because the moisture and saturation are different, and the temperature you feel by your skin is called ""wet-bulb temperature"", which is different from the real temperature indicated by a thermometer . The wet-bulb temperature is the temperature a parcel of air would have if it were cooled to saturation by the evaporation of water into it, with the latent heat being supplied by the parcel.A wet-bulb thermometer indicates a temperature close to the true temperature. The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient conditions by the evaporation of water only; it is the temperature felt when the skin is wet and exposed to moving air. Wet-bulb temperature is largely determined by both actual air temperature and humidity, the amount of moisture in the air.Look up Pascal's law, then read the post that talks about direct sunlight.",為什麼我的恆溫器上的70°感覺與外部70°不同？,因為水分和飽和度不同，皮膚感受到的溫度稱為“濕圓形溫度”，這與溫度計指示的實際溫度不同。濕泡體溫度是如果水將水冷卻至飽和，將會有一個空氣的溫度。溫度。濕球溫度是僅通過水的蒸發而在當前環境條件下達到的最低溫度。當皮膚潮濕並暴露於移動的空氣時，溫度是溫度。濕球溫度在很大程度上取決於實際的氣溫和濕度，空氣中的水分量（抬高帕斯卡爾定律），然後閱讀有關陽光直射的帖子。
"Why does it take our eyes longer to adjust to the dark, than to the light?","Black and white light receptors are the ones that see best in the dark, as they are the most light sensitive. However, we see in color. Lots and lots of color. We have a lot many, many more color light receptors, which are not very good in the dark. So, when we lose the light, it takes much longer for the black and white receptors to ""take over"" as it wereAdjustment to high light is a quick physical process of your pupil constricting . It is a muscle movement which can take relatively quickly. Adjustment to dark is a slow chemical process that takes place in your eyes. The chemical [Rhodopsin] is a pigment that is in your retina and gives you your night vision. It is destroyed by exposure to light and takes about 45 minutes for your eye to regenerateTotally different to the other answer, but the reason why our eyes adjust quickly to light is to stop the light from damaging the eye. This means that it is protecting the body. However, lack of light does not damage the eye and so, the body has no incentive to make us adjust to dark quickly.",為什麼要適應黑暗比光需要更長的眼睛？,黑色和白光受體是在黑暗中最能看見的受體，因為它們是最敏感的。但是，我們看到了顏色。很多顏色。我們還有很多更多的彩色照明受體，在黑暗中不是很好。因此，當我們失去光線時，黑白受體需要更長的時間才能“接管”，因為它可以使其高光是您的學生收縮的快速物理過程。這是一種肌肉運動，可以相對較快。對黑暗的調整是一種緩慢的化學過程，它發生在您的眼睛中。化學[Rhodopsin]是一種在視網膜中的色素，可以為您提供夜視。它被光線暴露而破壞，您的眼睛大約需要45分鐘才能與另一個答案不同，但是我們眼睛迅速調整到光線的原因是阻止光線損壞眼睛。這意味著它正在保護身體。但是，缺乏光不會損害眼睛，因此，身體沒有動力使我們迅速適應黑暗。
How much pain does a does a prisoner undergoing lethal injection feel?,"In the system used in the US the first drug that's injected is a powerful anesthetic that renders you unconscious and, therefore, unable to feel pain. The second stops your muscles and the third stops your heart. There have been allegations in one or two cases that the level of the first drug isn't enough to cause complete unconsciousness and that they would have felt the pain from the subsequent injections but, due to the nature of the second drug, the person would be unable to express it before dying. But, because pain is a conscious sense, there's no way to know for sure if they felt any pain.",接受致命注射的囚犯會感到多少疼痛？,在美國使用的系統中，第一種注入的藥物是一種強大的麻醉劑，使您失去知覺，因此無法感到疼痛。第二次停止了您的肌肉，第三個停止了您的心。在一兩個案例中，有人指控第一種藥物的水平不足以引起完全的無意識，並且他們會從隨後的注射中感到痛苦，但是由於第二種藥物的性質在死前無法表達它。但是，由於痛苦是一種有意識的感覺，因此無法確定他們是否感到痛苦。

Why we still have external hard-drives that need a power plug?,"The bigger ones use desktop hard drives, the desktop drives need 12 volts to spin the motor. The more compact models are laptop based hard drives, which use 5 volt motors. USB can supply 5 volts, but it can't supply 12v, so the bigger drives need an external power supply.Desktop drives are fast and high capacityfor the price. Example: I have an external 4TB drive I use to backup my PC: a 4TB laptop drive of that capacity would be much slower and a SSD very expensive.",為什麼我們仍然有需要電源插頭的外部硬盤驅動器？,較大的人使用台式硬盤驅動器，台式機驅動器需要12伏來旋轉電動機。更緊湊的模型是基於筆記本電腦的硬盤驅動器，使用5伏電動機。USB可以提供5伏，但不能提供12V，因此更大的驅動器需要外部電源。Desktop驅動器的價格快且高容量。示例：我有一個外部4TB驅動器用於備份我的PC：該容量的4TB筆記本電腦驅動器將要慢得多，而SSD非常昂貴。

How/why are feelings of sadness and anger connected?,"Anger is considered a ""secondary emotion."" Meaning that we feel another feeling first. This feeling is usually fear or sadness.

We can then deal with this feeling of sadness or fear later when we are no longer is emotional or physical danger.",悲傷和憤怒的感覺如何/為什麼？,憤怒被認為是“次要情緒”。這意味著我們首先感覺到另一種感覺。這種感覺通常是恐懼或悲傷。通過生氣，我們能夠保護自己免受引起我們悲傷或恐懼的人們或情況。然後，當我們不再是情感或身體上的危險時，我們可以在以後處理這種悲傷或恐懼的感覺。
How do pipes for tap water keep mold and other contaminants from growing?,"The pipes are sealed, and the only thing that goes into them is pre-treated, clean water. Mold and bacteria doesn't just materialize out of thin air. They have to get into it somehow.Mold grows very similarly to a plant, root system and all. Mold spores float in the air and when they land on a surface that has food, water, and air, they will grow. So the first condition is the presence of water. Obviously the inside of a pipe has water. Next they need a surface that made or organic material. This provides food and someplace for the roots to grow into. Unfortunately the inside of the pipe does not support this. Finally mold needs air, and again if the inside of a pipe is full of water there is no air. For these reasons mold does not grow inside pipes.",自來水管道如何防止黴菌和其他污染物生長？,管道是密封的，唯一進入它們的東西是預處理的清潔水。黴菌和細菌不僅僅是從稀薄的空氣中實現。他們必須以某種方式進入它。種植與植物，根系和所有人的生長非常相似。黴菌孢子漂浮在空氣中，當它們降落在具有食物，水和空氣的表面時，它們會生長。因此，第一個條件是水的存在。顯然，管道的內部有水。接下來，他們需要製成或有機材料的表面。這為根源提供了食物和某個地方。不幸的是，管道內部不支持這一點。最後，黴菌需要空氣，如果管道內部充滿水，則沒有空氣。由於這些原因，黴菌不會在管道內生長。

"Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?","The smell lingers as long as you're drunk because it's not coming from residual booze in your saliva, it's the smell of your blood itself. When you imbibe an alcoholic beverage, ethanol , is absorbed into your bloodstream. Ethanol is a volatile chemical , so when alcoholic blood passes through your lungs, some of the ethanol evaporates into the air that you exhale. It's this process that allows a breathalyzer to measure BAC based on your exhalation.Alcohol is volatile and easily vaporizes into the air, allowing you to smell it. Alcohol also is carried in the blood, which easily vaporizes in the lungs, from your blood stream, allowing you to breath it out. Coke is simply digested. You would only have residual coke after taste in your mouth, and would not be exhaling it from your lungs.Because no one seems to know the right answer: _URL_0_ After an extended period drinking alcohol is metabolised to acetone which is released through skin pores and through the lungs as you breath out. Acetone is the distinct smell that you find on drunks. A bit of trivia: diabetes sufferers are more prone to ketoacidosis than a healthy individual. edit: As u/3111111111 points out alcohol is not metabolised to acetone, it's metabolised to acetaldehyde. Over consumption inhibits the synthesis of glucose which leads to fatty acids being metabolised to acetone.",當非酒精飲料（例如可樂）不飲料時，為什麼酒精會在您的呼吸中留下如此可識別的氣味？,只要您喝醉了，氣味就會徘徊，因為它不是來自唾液中殘留的酒，而是血液本身的氣味。當您吸收酒精飲料時，乙醇被吸收到您的血液中。乙醇是一種揮發性的化學物質，因此當酒精血液通過肺部時，一些乙醇會蒸發到您呼氣的空氣中。正是這一過程使呼吸分析儀可以根據您的呼氣來測量BAC。酒精是揮發性的，很容易蒸發到空氣中，使您可以聞到它的氣味。酒精也被帶入血液中，該血液很容易從您的血液中蒸發在肺中，使您可以呼吸。可樂是消化的。您只會在嘴裡味道後才有殘留的可樂，並且不會從肺部呼氣。呼吸時通過肺部穿過。丙酮是您在醉酒中發現的獨特氣味。一點瑣事：糖尿病患者比健康的個體更容易患酮酸酸性病。編輯：由於U/3111111111指出酒精未代謝丙酮，因此將其代謝為乙醛。過度消耗抑制葡萄糖的合成，從而導致脂肪酸被代謝為丙酮。
Why do fridges pop and bang (very loudly),"It's likely the defrost cycle. Refrigerators work with a liquid that gets compressed by the compressor then allowed to expand inside some tubes. That expansion absorbs heat from inside the ice box, making the area cold. Unfortunately, a limitation of the refrigerant is this process happens at only a pretty cold temperature, about that of freezing ice. So because of that the moisture in the air of the ice box gets frozen on the coils inside. So ironically, there's a heater in there that melts the ice off the coils every hour or two. It's called a defroster. As that ice melts and heats up, sometimes it cracks and breaks, dropping into a drip tray. That's the sound you're hearing. :)"", 'Cracks, pops and bangs may be your ice maker.

How come when people flush a toilet the shower water gets cold instead of hot?,"Usually when you flush the toilet, the water in the shower gets much hotter. The toilet is ""stealing"" some of the cold water from your shower when it flushes, which means the ratio of hot to cold water is higher. If you are experiencing the opposite, it may be something wrong with your tap. Most modern homes use pressure-balancing valve for the tub & shower. These are designed to prevent you from getting burned in the shower when someone else flushes the toilet. They do this by reducing the amount of hot water that goes through the shower, whenever the amount of cold water is reduced. It could be that yours isn't working right, or needs to be adjusted.Flushing the toilet usually makes the shower hotter, not colder. If yours is reversed, it's definitely not typical.All the water, hot and cold, ultimately come from the same source and any changes in water pressure effect both hot and cold taps. If you already have low water pressure, the drop in pressure from the toilet refilling might be enough to basically stop the flow to your shower.",當人們沖洗廁所時，淋浴水會變冷而不是熱？,通常，當您沖洗廁所時，淋浴中的水會變熱得多。廁所沖水時正在從淋浴中“偷走”一些冷水，這意味著熱水與冷水的比率更高。如果您遇到的情況相反，那麼您的水龍頭可能有問題。大多數現代房屋都使用壓力平衡閥進行浴缸和淋浴。這些旨在防止您在其他人沖洗廁所時被淋浴燃燒。每當減少冷水量時，他們通過減少淋浴中流過的熱水量來做到這一點。可能是您的工作不正常，或者需要調整。刷新廁所通常會使淋浴變熱，而不是更冷。如果您的逆轉，那絕對不是典型的。所有的水，冷熱，最終來自相同的來源，水壓的任何變化都效果熱和冷龍頭。如果您的水壓已經低，則廁所重新裝滿壓力的下降可能足以阻止流向淋浴的流量。
"Why do humans have a degree of immaturity, and why is it more present in younger people?","By its definition, psychological immaturity is a behavior that only humans can experience. Physical immaturity is just the physiological state of not being an adult of your species. Because human brains develop over a very long period of time , it goes through various phases. Only once a person has reached the age of about 25 does it stop growing and changing. Because of this long-term development, psychological maturity isn't reached until well into physical adulthood . The younger a person is, the more their brain needs to continue development to reach full maturity. You can sort of equate this to physical size; the youngest people are smaller than fully grown adults, and it's merely because they're younger. The same can be said of brains and psychological maturity. The youngest people have smaller, less developed brains, and are therefore less mature . Aside from just needing to physically age, not everyone finishes brain development at the same time . There are many psychological theories that suggest that some people don't ever reach full psychological maturity. You'll be able to find more information about those theories by searching for **cognitive development** on the internet, or through your local library. The most common and easy-to-read theory was put forth by Piaget, so you could start there if you wished.",為什麼人類有一定程度的不成熟，為什麼它在年輕人中更存在？,根據其定義，心理不成熟是只有人類才能體驗的行為。身體上的不成熟只是您不成年的生理狀態。由於人的大腦在很長一段時間內發展出來，因此經歷了各個階段。只有一個人達到25歲的年齡才能停止增長和變化。由於這種長期的發展，直到身體成年才達到心理成熟度。一個人的年齡較小，他們的大腦需要繼續發展才能完全成熟。您可以將其等同於物理尺寸；最小的人比完全成年的成年人小，這僅僅是因為他們年輕。大腦和心理成熟也可以這樣說。最小的人的大腦較小，發達的較少，因此成熟。除了需要身體上的年齡，並不是每個人都同時完成大腦發育。有許多心理理論表明，有些人從未達到完全的心理成熟。您可以通過在Internet上或通過您的本地圖書館搜索**認知發展**來找到有關這些理論的更多信息。最常見且易於閱讀的理論是由Piaget提出的，因此，如果您願意，您可以從那裡開始。
how is brushing too hard more damaging to enamel than the tools the dentists use during cleaning?,"They do. But you go to the dentist twice a year but brush at least every day. If you sand and polish a wooden table every once in a while, you'll have a nice looking table. If you sand it every day, after a few years you won't have much of a table left. Also, they're usually targeting the tartar and scraping that off, not your enamel. Like using a wire brush on a rusty car. It's a ""necessary evil"". Wash and polish your car every day, but only scrape off the rust every once in a while. In fact, if you wash your car daily it won't develop nearly as much rust and you won't have to get it scraped off nearly as often.Let's say your teeth are a car. When the dentist scrapes your teeth he is using the equivalent of a high powered pressure washer to get off the solidified mud. However when you brush you teeth too hard/with stiff bristles you are using the equivalent to a metal wire brush to clean the dirt off your car, eventually, you will brush off the paint of your car . This isn't the best analogy but it gets the essentials to it"", 'Your dentist scrapes at your teeth, carefully, for 10 minutes maybe a couple times a year. You brush your teeth maybe a couple times a day. Additionally, depending on when you brush and what your diet is like, you may be brushing at times when the enamel has been weakened by the acidic activities of mico-organisms in your mouth. This can help allow a firm brush to damage enamel that would ordinarily resist wear better.",與牙醫在清潔過程中使用的工具相比，刷牙對搪瓷的破壞性更大嗎？,他們是這樣。但是您每年兩次去牙醫，但至少每天都要刷。如果您不時打磨並拋光木桌，您將有一張漂亮的桌子。如果您每天打磨它，幾年後，您將剩下太多的桌子。另外，它們通常針對牙垢並將其刮掉，而不是搪瓷。就像在生鏽的汽車上使用鋼絲刷一樣。這是“必要的邪惡”。每天清洗並拋光您的汽車，但只會偶爾刮掉生鏽。實際上，如果您每天洗車，它不會產生幾乎太多的生鏽，並且您不必頻繁地將其刮掉。當牙醫刮擦牙齒時，他正在使用相當於高功率的高壓清洗機來脫落固化的泥漿。但是，當您用硬毛刷牙/用硬毛刷牙齒時，您正在使用等同於金屬線刷以清潔汽車的污垢，最終，您將刷掉汽車的油漆。這不是最好的類比，但它得到了它的要點。關於刷牙和飲食的樣子，您可能有時會因牙釉質在嘴裡的酸性活性而削弱牙釉質的刷子。更好的。

what happened in Dunkirk?,"Basically, the french had a big defensive position along the German border. The French could have defended that position relatively easily. So the obvious way the german would have attacked was like during WW1 through Belgium where there is not as much defensive position like Bunkers. So the French and English positioned most of the division there to stop the Germans. The problem is that there is the Ardennes Forest between the defensive position of the Maginot Line and the bulk of the Franco-British forces in belgium. This region was view as impassible for a modern army. You can make your canons and truck go through a thick forest with no road. The problems is that they didn't understood that tanks were now strong enough to just go through the forest and create a path on their own. So now the French and English forces in Belgium were encircle by the German forces at the german/belgium boder, and those that went through the Ardennes. The only place to escape was by sea so these forces retreated to ports and boast kept taking these men to England. Dunkirk was the port were most of this evacuation took place.",敦刻爾克發生了什麼事？,基本上，法國人在德國邊境上的防守位置很高。法國人本來可以相對容易地捍衛該職位。因此，德國人本來會攻擊的明顯方式就像在第二次世界大戰期間通過比利時，那裡沒有像掩體那樣多的防守位置。因此，法國人和英語將大部分部門定位在那裡，以阻止德國人。問題在於，馬格諾特線的防禦地位與比利時的弗朗西 - 英國部隊之間存在阿登森林。對於現代軍隊而言，該地區認為這是無法通行的。您可以使您的佳能和卡車穿過沒有道路的茂密森林。問題在於，他們不了解坦克現在足夠強大，可以穿越森林並自己創造一條道路。因此，現在比利時的法國和英國軍隊被德國/比利時博德的德國軍隊以及經過阿登斯的那些人包圍。唯一要逃脫的地方是海上，因此這些部隊退回到港口，並誇口不斷將這些人帶到英國。敦刻爾克（Dunkirk）是港口的大部分疏散。
"What makes a college ""IVY"" League? Following, what must happen in order for a university to achieve an IVY status?","The Ivy League is pretty much set in stone. It's not a status, it's more of an historical grouping of eight elite schools in the northeast, which are old as dirt, for the most part. This includes Harvard, Yale, Penn, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Brown, and Cornell. All but one was founded before the declaration of independence was signed. So getting into the club now is kind of impossible. The Ivy League is also an athletic conference started in the 50's, but the phrase ""Ivy League"" predates the conference substantiallyIt's not a status -- it's an athletic conference. It's the same as what makes a school a Pac-10 or ACC school. That's why it's called the ivy ""league,"" i.e., a group of sports clubsYou can't just become an Ivy League college. The league pretty much already exists: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale. It is actually an athletic conference, but it refers to this group of schools that are considered the most difficult to get into and most respected in the US. There are a number of colleges that are called ""new Ivies"" or ""Ivies of the South"" , but none of these are actually Ivies. They get this nickname by being very high quality and therefore supposedly comparable to Ivy schools.The Ivy League is just 8 very old schools who plays a lot of sports with each other and decided to form themselves into a group. They all happen to be very prestigious schools, but it's not any sort of accreditation or award of status.",是什麼使大學“常春藤”聯盟？隨後，為了使大學獲得常春藤狀態，該怎麼辦？,常春藤聯盟幾乎是石頭的。這不是一個地位，而是東北八所精英學校的歷史組，大部分是泥土。其中包括哈佛，耶魯大學，賓夕法尼亞州，普林斯頓，達特茅斯，哥倫比亞，棕色和康奈爾。除了一個之外，所有人都是在簽署獨立宣言之前建立的。因此，現在進入俱樂部是不可能的。常春藤聯盟也是一個運動會議，在50年代開始，但“常春藤聯盟”的短語早於會議大幅度不是地位，這是一個運動會議。這與使學校成為Pac-10或ACC學校的原因相同。這就是為什麼它被稱為常春藤的“聯盟”，即一組體育俱樂部不能只是成為常春藤聯盟的大學。聯盟幾乎已經存在：布朗，哥倫比亞，康奈爾，達特茅斯，哈佛，普林斯頓，烏普恩和耶魯大學。這實際上是一個運動會議，但它指的是這群學校被認為是最難進入和最受尊重的學校。有許多被稱為“新的ivies”或“南方的ivies”的大學，但實際上這些都不是ivies。他們通過非常高質量獲得了這個暱稱，因此據說可以與常春藤學校相提並論。常春藤聯盟只有8所非常舊的學校，他們彼此參加了很多運動，並決定將自己組成一個小組。他們恰好是非常享有聲望的學校，但這不是任何認證或地位的認證。
&  American: What is the BBC?,"Imagine if NPR or PBS were a full media company with TV programing and news in tv, radio, and print and had actual support from the government.British Broadcasting Corporation is the UK's public broadcaster .",＆American：BBC是什麼？,想像一下，如果NPR或PBS是一家完整的媒體公司，電視，廣播和印刷中的電視節目和新聞，並得到了政府的實際支持。英國廣播公司是英國的公共廣播公司。
How are parrots able to imitate human voice?,"To them, it is not a voice, but just a sound they hear all the time. They have evolved the ability to mimic sounds they hear often enough. Not sure what purpose it serves, but they did. Pet birds hear the sounds of the humans they live with, so they mimic them. Even the ones that have been trained to respond to commands have no idea what those sounds mean they are just trained to respond to a specific sound by repeating another soundI found a nice article about it written in very clear language. _URL_0_', ""They don't, they imitate certain sounds if you listen close enough, you only hear part of words but, our brain uses magic and makes us hear complete words Well, that's my theory anyway",鸚鵡如何模仿人的聲音？,對他們來說，這不是聲音，而只是他們一直聽到的聲音。他們發展了模仿經常聽到的聲音的能力。不確定它有什麼目的，但是他們做到了。寵物鳥聽到他們與人類同住的聲音，因此它們模仿它們。即使是經過訓練以響應命令的人也不知道這些聲音意味著什麼意味著他們只是通過重複另一位Soundi的訓練來響應特定的聲音，從而發現了一篇很好的文章，以非常清晰的語言編寫。_url_0_'，“他們不這樣做，如果您聽得足夠近，他們就會模仿某些聲音，您只會聽到一部分單詞
the legal concept of entrapment,"This is ELI5, so this is really simplified. The rules can vary greatly from place to place. Entrapment means that the police tricked someone into committing a crime that *they would not have committed otherwise*. That last part is the important thing. Leaving a bicycle unlocked and monitoring it to see if it gets stolen is generally **not** entrapment. Anyone not looking for a bike to steal would probably not even notice that it was unlocked, for example. Approaching someone with drugs in hand and assuring that person that the drugs are actually totally legal, generally, **is** entrapment. The person could claim that he only took the drugs because he was told they were legal. Things vary a lot, of course, but in general a defendant can only claim entrapment if something the police did caused him to do something he wouldn't have done otherwise. The line is very fine and tough to define precise, hence the rather obvious example I've given. *** To address your points: police stings generally rely on the police officer waiting for the person to approach them, or on the police officer approaching the person in a very non-threatening, relaxed way. If the offending person does the asking, there's very little chance that the police officer's actions caused the illegal behavior.Edit: apparently what I wrote is not true. I retract it.",陷阱的法律概念,這是ELI5，因此確實簡化了。規則的各個地方都可能差異很大。陷阱意味著警察欺騙了某人犯罪， *他們本來不會犯下的 *。最後一部分是重要的事情。將自行車解鎖並進行監視以查看是否被盜是否被**陷入困境。例如，任何不尋求偷自行車的人甚至都不會注意到它已解鎖。與某人接觸毒品並確保該人實際上完全合法，通常**是**陷入困境。該人可以聲稱他只服用毒品，因為他被告知他們是合法的。當然，情況有很大的不同，但是通常，被告只能聲稱當警察確實使他做某件事時，他本來不會做的事情。這條線非常好，很難定義精確，因此我給出了一個相當明顯的例子。***解決您的觀點：警察的刺痛通常依賴於等待該人接近他們的警察，或以一種非常不受威脅，放鬆的方式接近該人的警察。如果犯罪的人要求詢問，那麼警察的行為幾乎沒有可能導致非法行為。我撤回。

Elon Musk says we can jump start the Mars atmosphere by setting off nukes on the poles. How does that work?,"Listen to /u/WRSaunders because he is speaking the truth. Some scientists believe that Mars already had a much stronger atmosphere a long time ago, but once the core of the planet cooled the sun's radiation ripped it apart. So even if sending the evaporated polar caps of Mars into its atmosphere did provide some sort of strengthened atmosphere, it would be short lived as most of it would simply float off into space.",埃隆·馬斯克（Elon Musk）說，我們可以通過在桿子上放下核武器來跳動火星氣氛。這是如何運作的？,聽 /u /wrsaunders，因為他說的是真相。一些科學家認為，火星很久以前就已經過著強烈的氣氛，但是一旦地球的核心使太陽的輻射撕裂了。因此，即使將火星的蒸發極蓋送入大氣層確實提供了某種強化的氣氛，它也會很短，因為它的大多數人都會只是漂浮在太空中。
What is the significance (in terms of the national convention) of a state's party endorsing a candidate?,"On the face of it, none.

How are seedless fruits grown if they can't pass on their genes through reproduction since they have no seeds to plant?,"To make new plants you use [cuttings] or [grafting]. Basically low-tech plant cloning. The seedless plants themselves you get my crossing varietes that happens to produce a sterile offspring seedless fruits are ""our inventions"". people created seedless fruits and we can still ""replicate them"", for instance by [grafting]Cloning, plant cloning is pretty easy, sometimes easier than using the seeds from plants that do have them.",如果無種子的果實不能通過繁殖傳遞基因，因為它們沒有種子可以種植？,為了製作新植物，您使用[插條]或[嫁接]。基本上是低科技植物克隆。無種子的植物本身，您會得到我的交叉品種恰好產生無菌後代的無種子水果是“我們的發明”。人們創造了無種子的水果，我們仍然可以“複製它們”，例如，通過[嫁接]克隆，植物克隆非常容易，有時比使用擁有它們的植物的種子更容易。
how exactly does an EMP destroy electronics?,"An EMP creates a huge, rapid change in electric and magnetic fields. Any closed circuits, when exposed to a changing magnetic field, will have some current induced in them. If the change in the magnetic field is strong and fast enough, the current generated could be enough to fry components of the circuit, which essentially destroys the circuit.",EMP如何破壞電子產品？,EMP在電場和磁場上產生了巨大的快速變化。當暴露於變化的磁場時，任何閉合電路都會在其中引起一些電流。如果磁場的變化很強且足夠快，則產生的電流可能足以炸電路的組件，從而實質上會破壞電路。

why do painkillers feel so good?,"the good feeling you get while taking opiate painkillers is because these drugs stimulate the pleasure system in your brain -- especially involving the neurotransmitter ""dopamine"", and other brain molecules called ""endorphins"", that help your body feel good. the brain rapidly adjusts to the presence of painkillers though and becomes far less sensitive to them, requiring more and more painkiller to achieve a positive feeling. this tends to lead to addiction and abuse. interestingly we don't yet know 100% exactly what painkillers do inside the brain, as it is a pretty complicated organ and is difficult to study. generally though, we know these drugs activate the pleasure system.",為什麼止痛藥感覺很好？,服用鴉片止痛藥時獲得的好感覺是因為這些藥物刺激了大腦中的愉悅系統 - 尤其是涉及神經遞質“多巴胺”，而其他稱為“內啡肽”的腦分子，可以幫助您的身體感覺良好。大腦迅速適應了止痛藥的存在，並且對它們的敏感程度遠不那麼敏感，需要越來越多的止痛藥才能獲得積極的感覺。這往往會導致成癮和虐待。有趣的是，我們還不知道100％的止痛藥在大腦內部做什麼，因為它是一個非常複雜的器官，很難研究。不過，通常，我們知道這些藥物激活了愉悅系統。
"Why do car seats for children ""expire""","Plastics deteriorate over time, and most car seats are made of plastic. Especially considering that a car seat is typically exposed to constantly changing temperatures it will change the properties of the plasticHair line fractures develop in the plastic and the elastic become less stretchy. If you want a more in depth article on it go to this link. _URL_0_[Taken from here] Ill just copy/paste because its a pretty good explanation: * Technology Improves and Standards Change. A good example of this is that back in 2002 car seats were not even equipped with Lower Anchor and Tethers for Children . Now however, they are a standard feature in nearly all car seats. Car seat expiration dates ensure that seats being used are current and up to snuff. * Materials Wear Down. Car seats were not made to last forever. Overtime the seat base can develop hairline fractures which may shatter in a crash, and belts can become slightly elastic after years of use. Crash test videos provide a chilling example of how these materials can fail in a devastating manner. * Only Tested for a Certain Period. After a certain amount of time, manufacturers do not test seats. They cannot attest to how older seats will perform in an accident. So the biggest reason seems to be that the materials wear down",為什麼要為兒童的汽車座椅“到期”,隨著時間的流逝，塑料會惡化，大多數汽車座椅都是由塑料製成的。尤其是考慮到汽車座椅通常會暴露於不斷變化的溫度下，它將改變塑料中plastichair線骨折的特性，並且彈性會變得不那麼彈性。如果您想要更多的深入文章，請訪問此鏈接。_url_0_ [從這裡取] ill只是複制/粘貼，因為它的一個很好的解釋： *技術改進和標準變化。一個很好的例子是，回到2002年的汽車座椅甚至還沒有配備兒童的較低錨和系托。但是，現在，它們幾乎是所有汽車座椅的標準功能。汽車座椅的到期日期確保使用的座椅是最新的，最多可鼻涕。*材料磨損。汽車座椅不是永遠持續的。加班座椅可能會出現髮際線骨折，這些骨折可能會在撞車事故中崩潰，並且經過多年的使用後，皮帶會變得有些彈性。碰撞測試視頻提供了一個令人震驚的例子，說明這些材料如何以毀滅性的方式失敗。*僅測試一定時間段。一定時間後，製造商不測試座位。他們無法證明較舊的座位在事故中的表現。因此，最大的原因似乎是材料磨損
"Do men snore more than women, and if so, why?","I'm not entirely sure, but there is of course sexual dimorphism between male and female, males are physically structured different than females. Women have breasts, men don't. Men have broader shoulders, women don't and etc. So the respiratory structures may also be different in such a way that vibrations are more likely to occur.My idea is that one only snores while sleeping on their back. Men have wider shoulders, so are more likely to sleep on their back.",男人比女人打s，如果是的話，為什麼？,我不確定，但是男性和雄性之間的性二態性當然，男性的身體結構與女性不同。女人有乳房，男人沒有。男人的肩膀，女人沒有等。因此，呼吸結構也可能以振動更有可能發生的方式不同。我的想法是，一個人只在睡覺時就打s。男人的肩膀更寬，因此更有可能睡在背上。

Western nations do equally brutal things; that's WHY ISIS rose to power in the first place, as a reaction to brutality.",作為中產階級西方人，我該怎麼做才能與ISIS作戰？,可能會遇到被宣傳所吸引的人。主要是年輕人。我懷疑您可以做任何重要的事情來影響實際的ISIS組織。支持鼓勵穩定中東，寫您的政治代表的智能政策，並且不要為ISIS的伊斯蘭恐懼症而墮落，即ISIS是邪惡的縮影。西方國家同樣殘酷的事情；這就是為什麼ISIS首先要上台，這是對殘酷的反應。
"What exactly (or at least usually) happens to the body when a human dies of ""natural causes""?","Natural Causes typically means the person died because their body couldn't handle living any more. It would probably involve one or more organs shutting down and the result killing the rest of the organs and the person. I don't know if there are organs that are particularly prone to this.Death by natural causes refers to a death caused by a fatal organ failure related to age-related degradation. It's not always clearcut though, as different doctors will draw the line at different places. Technically, death by disease is ""natural"", as is death by various other causes. It's rare that a death is purely caused by age-related failure, and opportunistic infections may also be involved.",當人類死於“自然原因”時，身體到底發生了什麼（或至少通常）？,自然原因通常意味著該人死亡，因為他們的身體無法應付生活。它可能涉及一個或多個器官關閉，結果殺死了其餘的器官和人。我不知道是否有特殊對此的器官。天然原因是指由與年齡相關的降解有關的致命器官失敗造成的死亡。不過，這並不總是清晰的，因為不同的醫生會在不同的地方劃清界限。從技術上講，疾病的死亡是“自然的”，其他各種原因也是死亡。死亡純粹是由年齡相關的失敗引起的，而且可能涉及機會性感染。
"Why do my pits sweat profusely, even when it's cold outside?","If you regularly bathe & use antiperspirant, here's a few things you can do: * Shave/trim your armpit hair. All that hair provides a lot of room for bacteria to grow & makes it harder to get the antiperspirant to your skin .* If it's cold outside, you may be bundling up a lot. If your core is too warm, you will sweat. Try wearing less clothing or something that can let more air flow through - preventing the moisture from building up.* Along those lines - does it always happen or just when wearing certain fabrics? Try wearing different shirts - it can make a difference.* If you keep trying things and nothing pans out, see a dermatologist. They might be able to find something that's wrong with your skin or just give you a heavy-duty antiperspirant. As one of the other posters mentioned, hormones might be the problem. If you're in your teens or early 20s, you might just have to wait to grow out of it.",為什麼即使外面很冷，我的坑也會大量流汗？,如果您定期洗澡並使用止汗劑，則可以做一些事情： *剃光/修剪腋毛。所有的頭髮為細菌生長提供了很大的空間，使抗精神病劑更難使您的皮膚變成您的皮膚。*如果外面很冷，您可能會捆綁很多。如果您的核心太熱了，您將出汗。嘗試穿更少的衣服或可以讓更多空氣流動的東西 - 防止水分建立。嘗試穿不同的襯衫 - 可以有所作為。他們可能能夠找到您的皮膚出錯的東西，或者只是給您重型抗精神病手。正如提到的其他海報之一，激素可能是問題所在。如果您在十幾歲或20多歲的時候，您可能只需要等待即可長大即可。
"Why do people say to not discuss religion or politics on a first date? If the relationship ever gets serious, won't differences on those subjects cause problems?","Differences of opinion will create strife within a relationship. There isn't a way around this.

"Why Politicians taking ""donations"" in exchange for favorable policies is not corruption?","It's only illegal if it's clearly in exchange for money. If there's a candidate who thinks oil subsidies are a good idea then naturally the oil companies will support her. If she gets elected and then votes for oil subsidies is that because she was bribed or were her policies the reasons she got donations in the first place? This is also the reason that there are limits on campaign spending. Congress didn't want to limit who you could support with money, but they didn't want to give the appearance of impropriety or allow for actual impropriety. If you want to support a candidate you have to donate to a PAC that supports them after a certain point. The PAC is supposed to operate independently of the candidate so you can't pay the candidate directly for preferential treatment, etc. I don't think it actually provides that much protection against that sort of thing in the end, but it's supposed to add an insulating layer between donors and politicians.",為什麼政治家以“捐款”來換取有利的政策不是腐敗？,只有顯然是為了換取金錢，這是非法的。如果有一個候選人認為石油補貼是個好主意，那麼石油公司自然會支持她。如果她當選，然後對石油補貼進行投票，那就是因為她被賄賂還是她的政策是她首先獲得捐款的原因？這也是競選支出受到限制的原因。國會不想限制您可以用金錢支持的人，但他們不想賦予不當行為的外觀或允許實際不當行為。如果您想支持候選人，則必須向PAC捐款，該PAC在某個點之後支持他們。PAC應該獨立於候選人進行操作，因此您不能直接向候選人支付優惠待遇等。我認為它實際上並不能最終提供對此類事情的太多保護，但應該添加捐助者和政客之間的絕緣層。
"How can the keep economy keep ""growing""? The earth doesn't get any bigger, so what does this growth mean?","Consider the broken window fallacy. Say I break a window. The window maker gets paid by me. I get paid by parents for looking after their kid. The parents get paid for cutting the hair of the window maker. Are we at net zero? Almost, but our community temporarily has only gotten back to square one. Now consider if I hadn't broken a window but wanted to install a new one. The window maker gets paid by me. I get paid by parents for looking after their kid. The parents get paid for cutting the hair of the window maker. Are we at net zero? Hell no we have a whole new window in our community! That growth of gaining a window can be applied to any object or service. It is economic growth in a nutshell.It's 1900 and you have a farm. You produce 100 tomatoes. This takes 100 hours of work. Now, it's 1950, and your child runs the farm. They invent a better tomato seed. Now, with 50 hours of work, they produce 100 tomatoes, but they still work 100 hours, and so produce 200 tomatoes. Now the world has the same amount of human work, but twice as many delicious, delicious tomatoes. In 2000, your grandchild runs the farm, and they higher a helper. Previously, the helper worked at a farm that used the old seeds, so they only produced 100 tomatoes a year. When they move to your farm, they have the new seeds, and they produce 200. Now there are 400 tomatoes in the world, because there were more people to work the farm. Thus, the tomato economy grows as production becomes more efficient, or more inputs become available, even though the ""farm"" is the same size. Works the same for computer chips, oil, lawyers, and most everything else. We learn to use things better or differently.",如何保持經濟保持“增長”？地球沒有變大，那麼這種增長意味著什麼？,考慮窗口破裂的謬論。說我打破了一個窗戶。窗戶製造商得到了我的薪水。我因照顧他們的孩子而得到父母的報酬。父母因剪掉窗戶製造商的頭髮而獲得報酬。我們在淨零嗎？幾乎，但是我們的社區暫時只回到了第一方。現在考慮一下我是否沒有打破窗口，但想安裝新的窗口。窗戶製造商得到了我的薪水。我因照顧他們的孩子而得到父母的報酬。父母因剪掉窗戶製造商的頭髮而獲得報酬。我們在淨零嗎？地獄不，我們社區中有一個全新的窗口！獲得窗口的增長可以應用於任何對像或服務。簡而言之，這是經濟的增長。1900年，您有一個農場。您會生產100個西紅柿。這需要100個小時的工作。現在是1950年，您的孩子經營著農場。他們發明了更好的番茄種子。現在，有50個小時的工作，它們會產生100個西紅柿，但仍在工作100小時，因此產生了200個西紅柿。現在，世界擁有相同數量的人類作品，但美味的西紅柿是兩倍。在2000年，您的孫子經營著農場，他們更高的幫手。以前，助手在一個使用舊種子的農場工作，因此他們每年只生產100份西紅柿。當他們搬到您的農場時，他們會有新的種子，然後生產200個。現在，世界上有400個西紅柿，因為有更多的人可以在農場工作。因此，即使“農場”的規模相同，番茄經濟會隨著產量變得更加高效或更多的投入而增長。對於計算機芯片，石油，律師和其他所有內容，都可以使用相同的工作。我們學會更好或不同。
Why do some smells seem amplified in the rain?,"Smells not amplified, always there at same level but the moisture opens nose and makes it a more efficient smelling machine so you pick up more. You'll find you get same effect in shower if you pay attention.There are two reasons. The first, as the other redditor explained is that molecules travel more quickly through moist air, so you do a better job of noticing them, but there is something else going on here, particularly when rain falls on *dry, hard* earth. Raindrops may actually ""release"" scent molecules trapped on the ground. In a 2015 study, MIT researchers found that when raindrops hit surfaces, they created aerosols of the substances on the ground which are easier for people to smell. The harder the rain falls, the larger the drop, and the harder the surface, the more aerosol gets released and the stronger the smell. The phenomenon actually has a name, ""Petrichor,"" that dates back a very long time.",為什麼在雨中似乎有些氣味會散發出來？,氣味不會放大，總是在同一水平上，但是水分敞開了鼻子，使其成為更有效的氣味機器，因此您可以撿起更多。如果您注意的話，您會發現自己在淋浴時會獲得相同的效果。有兩個原因。首先，正如另一位Redditor解釋的那樣，分子在潮濕的空氣中更快地傳播，因此您可以更好地註意它們，但是這裡還有其他事情正在發生，尤其是當雨水落在 *乾燥，硬 *地球上時。雨滴實際上可能“釋放”被困在地面上的氣味分子。在2015年的一項研究中，麻省理工學院的研究人員發現，當雨滴撞擊表面時，他們在地面上創建了氣溶膠，人們更容易聞到。降雨越難降，滴越大，表面越難，氣霧劑釋放越多，氣味就越強。這種現象實際上有一個名字，“彼得里希爾”，它可以追溯到很長一段時間以來。
"Finland has one of the world's leading education system, and the United States has been falling behind; what's keeping the United States from following Finland's educational system?","Ignorance, Stubborn bureaucrats , aggressive lobbying, but more likely it's just that a majority of Americans are so damn proud and the belief that ""America = #1"" is so indoctrinated into our culture that we just won't take advice from other countries.The real big thing here is that the United States is **75 times** the size of Finland. Finland has a very homogenous population while America has a mixing pot of every race, culture, and background imaginable. This has lead to America having great disparity of wealth among it's citizens.",芬蘭是世界領先的教育體系之一，美國一直落後。是什麼使美國無法遵循芬蘭的教育體系？,無知，頑固的官僚，積極進取的遊說，但更有可能僅僅是，大多數美國人是如此自豪，並且相信“美國=＃1”是如此灌輸我們的文化，以至於我們不會從其他國家接受建議。真正的最大事情是，美國是芬蘭的規模75倍。芬蘭的人口非常均勻，而美國的每個種族，文化和背景都可以想像。這導緻美國在其公民之間存在很大的財富差異。

"Why does Los Angeles, The United States' 2nd largest metropolitan area, still not have an NFL team?","Reality seems to be that despite the population, the interest isn't there to justify it. They've lost 3 teams, they don't have an appropriate stadium, the NFL isn't looking to expand, and in general all teams are either fine in their current location, or exploring different areas There's also a 'Franchise value' argument to be made on the other side. The NFL could think LA is valuable enough a market that they aren't willing to pay for it, or give up anything They will simply wait until someone is willing to pay a huge amount to establish a franchise. A similar thing is occurring in the NHL, multiple parties are interested in a 2nd hockey team placed in Toronto, knowing it would be a financial success ordinarily a Hockey franchise would be about $150-200 Million to buy or establish. But a hypothetical 2nd team in Toronto would be worth atleast half a Billion so the league won't put one in or allow other owners to move there because they figure at some point someone will be willing to pay much more for it. Why let the Jaguars move to LA for free when they could let some guy pay $1 Billion for the right to open a new franchise there later on?"", 'Well, they had the Rams for quite a while. But they moved to St. Louis. Then they had the Raiders, but they moved to Oakland. Then they had the AFL Chargers, who moved to San Diego and joined the NFL. For the complete history of football in LA, check out the wiki ', ""From what I understand, it's because their main venue; The Coliseum was going to be the stadium, or they were going to build another one in the area.",為什麼美國第二大都市地區洛杉磯仍然沒有NFL球隊？,現實似乎是，儘管人口，但興趣並沒有證明這一點。他們輸掉了3支球隊，沒有適當的體育場，NFL不想擴展，總的來說，所有團隊在當前位置都很好，或者探索不同的地區也有一個“特許經營價值”參數在另一側製造。NFL可以認為洛杉磯足夠有價值的市場，他們不願意為此付出代價，或者放棄任何他們只會等到某人願意支付大量資金來建立特許經營的東西。NHL也發生了類似的事情，多個政黨對位於多倫多的第二個曲棍球隊感興趣，知道這通常是財務上的成功，通常是曲棍球特許經營權，即可購買或建立約1.50-2億美元。但是，在多倫多的一個假設的第二支球隊將至少值得十億，因此聯盟不會放入或允許其他所有者搬到那裡，因為他們認為某個時候有人會願意為此付出更多。當他們可以讓某個人以後支付10億美元的權利以稍後在那裡開設新特許經營權時，為什麼讓美洲虎免費搬到洛杉磯？”，'嗯，他們有一段時間的公羊。路易斯。然後他們有了突襲者，但他們搬到了奧克蘭。然後，他們有了AFL充電器，他們搬到了聖地亞哥並加入了NFL。有關洛杉磯的完整足球歷史，請查看Wiki'明白，這是因為他們的主要場所；體育館將是體育場，否則他們將在該地區建造另一個體育場。
Why can't we create artificially the best tasting champagne ever?,"If you can identify and synthesize all components of champagne, you could produce an identical product, by all means indistinguishable from the real thing. But the value of products like wine, whiskey and champagne isn't just their taste profile. It's the story behind it - the craftsmanship and the age-old tradition of making that product, as well as the prestige of the brand which make the product desirable. It would probably not even be difficult to create products that are objectively better and cheaper than the real thing just by using modern production techniques instead of the inefficient old ways. But your product would be far less desirable than the real stuff.While technically /u/Shekellarios is correct, the reality is that plants are better at making a broad number of esters in varying proportions than we are. We can synthesize esters, and even purify them reasonably well, but the sheer number of them present in subtle amounts in champagne would be a difficult task to duplicateLet's put aside the fact that ""best"" is subjective and people are going to have a personal preference. In theory yes, we could isolate every single compound and artificially mix it together to create this ""perfect"" champagne. The problem is, champagne is a complicated organic compound filled with countless different components. So we could either create countless processes and machines to isolate these thousands of different building blocks or we could just get some grapes, some yeast, and some barrels. The fact of the matter is that with modern technology, it's still infinitely easier to let nature do the work of creating champagne then it is to fake it. Even if you could actually create everything needed to isolate and combine every single component, you would have just succeeded in making the most impossibly expensive champagne and you would never come close to recouping the cost of doing so.",為什麼我們不能人為地創建有史以來最好的品嚐香檳？,如果您可以識別和合成香檳的所有成分，則可以生產相同的產品，這與真實物品無法區分。但是，葡萄酒，威士忌和香檳等產品的價值不僅僅是他們的口味概況。這是其背後的故事 - 工藝和製造該產品的古老傳統，以及使產品理想的品牌的聲望。僅僅使用現代生產技術而不是效率低下的舊方式，就可能很難創造出比真實事物更好，更便宜的產品。但是，您的產品比真正的東西要遠不如真正的東西。雖然技術 /u /shekellarios是正確的，但現實是，植物比以不同的比例更好地製作了大量的酯。我們可以合成酯，甚至可以很好地淨化酯，但是在香檳中以微妙的數量出現的酯數量將是一項艱鉅的任務。。從理論上講，我們可以將每種複合物隔離開來，然後人工將其混合在一起，以創建這種“完美”的香檳。問題是，香檳是一種複雜的有機化合物，充滿了無數不同的成分。因此，我們可以創建無數的工藝和機器來隔離這些數千個不同的構件，或者我們只能得到一些葡萄，一些酵母和一些桶。事實是，使用現代技術，讓大自然做創造香檳的工作比偽造它仍然是無限容易的。即使您實際上可以創建隔離和結合每個組件所需的一切，您也將成功製作最不可能的昂貴香檳，並且您永遠也永遠不會收回這樣做的成本。
The discovery of 2017 Nobel Prize winners in Medicine or Physiology,"Every cell in your body alters its activity on a daily cycle. This is called the circadian rhythm, and though it is influenced by light-dark cycles, it more-or-less persists even when an animal is kept in constant light or dark. Therefore, there must be some sort of internal clock that knows about how long a day is. What Hall, Young and Rosbash found was a way that cells keep time. Using fruit flies, they found genes that they named timeless and period. Genes are recipes for proteins, and the proteins made by these genes are called PER and TIM. PER and TIM are made during the night. When enough of them accumulate, they are able to shut down the period and timeless genes from making more PER and TIM. Then, during the day, PER and TIM are gradually destroyed by enzymes in the cell. This allows production of PER and TIM to start again. The whole cycle takes about 24 hrs. There are a number of other proteins involved that provide additional input to set the clock as well as other proteins that are affected by the clock to change the activity of the cells and of the whole organism.",發現2017年諾貝爾獎獲得者或生理學獲獎者,您體內的每個細胞都會在每日週期中改變其活動。這被稱為晝夜節律，儘管它受到淺黑暗週期的影響，但即使動物保持恆定的光或黑暗，它或無所不在。因此，必須有某種內部時鐘知道每天有多長時間。Hall，Young和Rosbash發現的是細胞保持時間的一種方式。他們使用果蠅發現了他們命名為永恆和時期的基因。基因是蛋白質的食譜，這些基因製造的蛋白質稱為per和tim。蒂姆和蒂姆是在夜間製造的。當它們積累得足夠多時，他們就能關閉時期和永恆的基因，從而使每個時期和蒂姆產生更多。然後，在白天，PER和TIM被細胞中的酶逐漸破壞。這允許生產Per和Tim重新開始。整個週期大約需要24小時。還有許多其他蛋白質提供了額外的輸入來設置時鐘以及受時鐘影響的其他蛋白質，以改變細胞和整個生物的活性。
Why do I close my eyes and clench by buthole when I'm scared?,"Your brain tries to keep the threath away by deleting the image of it. Since it's not possible for it to simply forger about it, it makes you close your eyes. This way, your brain has no more images of the threath to deal with. Your butthole get clenched because your body get ready for a fight or for a flight. Your muscles clench, giving your more strenght to run. Turns out, your butthole is a muscle, and your brain has not enough time to decide which muscle use and which not. So he uses them all",當我害怕時，為什麼我閉上眼睛並緊緊抓住荷葉？,您的大腦試圖通過刪除其圖像來保持毛毛。由於它不可能簡單地偽造它，因此它會讓您閉上眼睛。這樣，您的大腦就不再有要處理的毛髮的圖像。您的屁股會緊緊抓住，因為您的身體已經準備好打架或飛行。您的肌肉緊緊抓住，使您的肌肉更加奔跑。事實證明，您的屁股是肌肉，您的大腦沒有足夠的時間來決定使用哪種肌肉，哪些肌肉沒有。所以他都用了
